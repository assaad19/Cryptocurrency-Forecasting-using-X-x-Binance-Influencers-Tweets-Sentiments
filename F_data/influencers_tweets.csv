The first round ends on Monday, but you can still take a large bag home.  How?   It's super easy:  The competition rewards traders who collect the most #VELA Credits.  These credits are earned by performing a few actions in the protocol, such as trading, minting #VLP, using your referral code, and winning trades.  For round 1, the most effective strategy is to SHORT #BTC or #ETH  This strategy gives 3.5x more credits than going LONG on #SOL for example.  I did the math and tried it myself:  * Opening a SHORT Position on #BTC for $10,000 = 10,000 x 2 x 1,5 = 30,000 VELA CREDITS   * Opening a LONG Position on #SOL for $10,000 = 10,000 x 1 = 10,000 VELA CREDITS  You win #VELA Credits when you OPEN and ALSO when you close the position.  So you MUST close all your positions before the timer runs out.  The current TOP 10 will take home:  * First place 10K #ARB = $18,000   * Second place 6k #ARB = $10,800  * Third place will 4k #ARB = $7,200  The minimum amount of credits you need to farm to get into the TOP 100 is only 900k  It's incredibly easy, and you can do it using the strategy I described earlier.  Good luck, and I'll see you guys in Round 2 - where I expect much more fierce competition as the word about the prize pool is spreading like wildfire.  https://app.vela.exchange/prizes/grand-prix",01/28/2024 11:50 AM,False,34,7,25

Some of us were early investors in NuklaiData, securing positions at a remarkable pre-launch price of $0.003. Congratulations to those who seized this opportunity! For those looking to get a position; I anticipate a potential pullback below $0.04.  A short summary of the project for those who are still unfamiliar with NuklaiData.   ‚úÖAI Advancement through Decentralization NuklaiData is crucial for advancing Artificial Intelligence (AI) by offering a decentralized platform for secure and efficient data sharing and processing.  ‚úÖThe Quest for Quality In AI, data is essential for powering algorithms. Think of data as the lifeblood of AI. However, accessing diverse, high-quality datasets can be tough due to privacy concerns, data silos, and centralized control.  ‚úÖLeveraging Blockchain NuklaiData tackles these challenges by using blockchain tech to build a decentralized marketplace. Here, data providers can securely share their datasets while keeping ownership and control.  ‚úÖDemocratizing Data This opens the door for AI researchers and developers to access a variety of datasets, fostering collaboration and speeding up the creation of better AI models.  ‚úÖEnsuring Data Integrity NuklaiData's transparency and immutability make sure that data is trustworthy. This means you don't have to worry about someone changing it, which is essential for AI because it needs reliable information.  ‚úÖDriving AI Progress To sum up, NuklaiData's decentralized platform not only makes data exchange seamless but also boosts innovation and collaboration in AI, pushing us closer to more advanced and impactful AI solutions.",04/20/2024 12:03 PM,True,130,21,30

If it goes down 15%-25%, do nothing. There is nothing exciting about this. Just hold spot and chill. 5. If it goes down +50% and the whole market went down like this, you can use the stables (if you didn‚Äôt cash out to the bank) to buy some alts you follow.

Read on‚Ä¶  Crypto presents a very unique opportunity for wealth creation that is exciting and in many cases life changing.  I want to focus in on this key point: crypto can be LIFE CHANGING  What does this mean? Quite simply, if you make a lot of money, you can change your life if many ways:  - new car - buy a house - retire your parents, etc.  One of the most CRUCIAL parts of successful wealth creation, is understanding that past a certain point‚Ä¶the money doesn‚Äôt scale to the impact it will have on your life.  To make it very clear:  Your second million dollars will change your life INFINITELY LESS than your first.  Many people will make enough money to legitimately change their life forever (pay off debts, new house completely paid, college fund started for kids, etc.) and then they will RISK IT ALL to double their money.   What I‚Äôm trying to say is very very very simple:  If you make enough money to change your life, make sure you actually change it.  Do not risk an amount of money that can change your life forever, just so that you can then make your life a *little bit* better.  My one ask for anybody that reads this:  Find your number. Find the number that will change your life. Do NOT make this some arbitrary number like 2 million dollars. Write down the things that you need to change your life (car, house, debts, etc.) and then make that number your goal.  When you hit your goal, cash the fuck out.  If you don‚Äôt have a number, you will never stop until you lose it all. I promise you.  If you make enough money to change your life, make sure you actually change it.  The money does not scale.   The diminishing returns of wealth are real.",03/30/2024 05:35 PM,True,1532,397,231

One of the most promising new interoperability solutions is Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). CCIP enables cross-chain token transfers and message passing in a seamless and highly secure way.  I expect this protocol to be very successful, and that's why I'm very excited about this new cross-chain DEX @xswap_link which will be one of the very first protocols to integrate Chainlink‚Äôs CCIP technology.  XSwap is the first token led and brought to market by Chainlink's Incubator, and the first protocol to provide utility to the 21B+ dollars of $LINK tokens sitting idle.  XSwap enables cross-chain swaps between virtually any assets on any blockchains by utilizing CCIP for the cross-chain interactions and connections to DEX-es via aggregation. For the moment, the swap feature is in beta, and users can only swap between Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base and Optimism - but more chains are coming!  XSwap also offers a bridge for fast and secure cross-chain transfers, again powered by CCIP. There is currently a leaderboard designed to rank users based on their activity within the XSwap ecosystem - so it might be worth trying out the bridge and a few swaps. Do I hear airdrop? üëÄ  They‚Äôre also developing an SDK which will make it easy for other platforms to integrate swapping and bridging via XSwap, boosting trade volumes and revenue for the protocol!  The token for the project will be XSWAP, although you're so early it hasn't launched yet. It will be used for governance, revenue sharing fees from swaps and bridging, and there will even be a buyback and burn mechanism too!  I can't wait for $XSWAP to launch, and I recommend you follow @xswap_link to keep up to date with project developments!",03/30/2024 12:43 PM,True,766,163,284

Decentralized AI Layer 1. 2. Privacy: Efficient, fast and secure end-to-end encryption. (FHE and TFT) Optimized through a process called Cerberus Squeezing. 3. Large Language Models. 4. Yuma Consensus, ensuring constant competition among nodes (brains), fair reward distribution, and scalability. 5. EVM compatibility/smart contracts, dapps etc. 6. The ability for any existing service provider to transform their standard LLM's (Llama) into ZK-LLM's with BasedLang. 7. Written in BasedLang, a novel meta programming standard made just for BasedAI, making it easier for any dev to work with LLM's (crypto and non crypto). 8. Future compatibility with newer LLM's like GPT-5.  By now, you should already have a basic understanding of how the BasedAI network works. Today, we will add to that knowledge.

374,jyp,"TLDR for the TRUE story behind @pepecoins and what is @getbasedai all about:    1. The OG @pepecoins is the first ever #memecoin we had next to @dogecoin in 2016. It didn't launch through an ICO or smart contract as it was released before #Ethereum was a thing. It launched through mining like $BTC and $doge coin.    2. It was under the radar because bittrex forced them to rebrand to stay listed on their CEX. Why? In 2016, Pepecoin faced a major challenge, white supremacists and right-wing ideologists began using Pepe to spread their ideology and it reached a climax when Donald Trump posted a Pepe meme of himself. Hilary then accused Trump's campaign of maliciously spreading those Pepe memes.    3. the Anti Defamation League went on to list Pepe as a hate symbol and ultimately @pepecoins was forced to rebrand from $pepe to $meme. [Yes, as a loyal holder of @memeland assets, $meme was not the OG. $meme from @pepecoins was.]    4. In response to that, the @pepecoin team launched KEKDAQ, a decentralized meme and asset exchange protocol where users can store, create and safeguard their memes and digital assets preserving their rarity via encrypted IPFS storage on the memetic blockchain. Ultimately, @pepecoins team built the first functioning NFT marketplace we ever had, way before @opensea was a thing but it was out of the reason to maintain free speech and internet culture.    5. In 2018, the blockchain underwent a hard fork and @pepecoins started its transition phase from POW to POS. Finally on 29 Apr 2023, the team bridged #pepecoin to Eth using utxo lockups and named the eth based pepecoin $PEPE. However, $pepe was stolen by @pepecoineth in 2023. Team at @pepecoins mentioned that the 2023 $pepe stole their idea, narrative and even the logo and ran with it. Team also mentioned that what these bad actors cannot steal is their ability to innovate and they will dev their way to the top.    6. So here comes the next major phase of @pepecoins evolution : @getbasedai What is #basedAI? They are building an open AI Layer1 network where anyone can run their own decentralized AI model, powered by GPU mining or proof of useful work (PoUW) as they call it.    7. Pepecoin trains AI models by using an open source peer to peer decentralized pool of gpus and a proof of useful work model named PEPEAI allowing them to tap into raw computing power and that pool offers to train their very own chat AI bot called CHAT-GP33.    8. What they are building is that you could use your computer's power to contribute to training AI models. It goes way beyond a simple Chatbot, it is an entire infrastructure that uses the collective power of Orphan miners to train AI. It covers a wide range of applications that companies usually spend Millions on.     9. Contributions are rewarded just like in traditional mining if you provide 10% of the work, you receive 10% of the reward without wasting energy.    10. You can buy #pepecoin now and stake it to earn #basedAI.    11. NFA, DYOR and investing in good teams is the best way to win in the coming cycle. ^if you sux at shitcoin trading.    12.

On Bitcoin, for example, where inscriptions are currently most common, data such as text, images and videos is attached to individual sats (satoshis - the smallest unit of Bitcoin).  There's one protocol which is very well positioned to capture the growth of this new vertical - @inscribe_app  Inscribe is the first ever cross-chain inscriptions marketplace that enables users to trade inscriptions across multiple different blockchains in 1 unified hub. Version 0.1 is operational on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, ZkSync, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, Base, Fantom, Gnosis and Polygon!  Users can connect their preferred wallet like MM or Rabby and then purchase any inscription listed on Inscribe's marketplace, regardless of the chain it's on. Inscribe abstracts away the difficulty of bridging funds cross-chain and executing the transaction on the native chain, allowing users to interact with blockchains they are not natively operating on.  By offering a cross-chain marketplace with unified liquidity, Inscribe makes it easier than ever to trade this growing crypto asset class!  But Inscribe also offers many other inscription services beyond just a marketplace. The Inscribe web app and bot enables users to deploy, mint and transfer inscriptions on and between any connected chains. They‚Äôre also soon releasing their launchpad, with @Architex_ai already announced as the first project to be listed!  The platform will generate revenue by charging fees for their range on inscriptions services, and perhaps some of this revenue will be shared with stakers of the platform‚Äôs native token $INS  There is currently an ongoing incentivized points campaign, and with 7% of the supply allocated to an airdrop this could be a protocol worth interacting with!

Buy liquidated assets with a discount. #GHOST - The borrowing and lending platform. Borrow assets or lend them and earn yield. #BOW - Liquidity-providing tool that allows you to earn yield on your assets while it improves the trading experience on #FIN at the same time. #PILOT - A one-of-a-kind launchpad that enables you to determine the price you want to pay for a new token. #POD - A platform aiming to improve decentralization amongst the @cosmos ecosystem by helping you diversify your staked assets over different validators. #BLUE - The @TeamKujira dashboard and the place to mint $USK @SonarWallet - The mobile wallet developed by the team. It's still in beta but will develop into a mobile gateway that gives you access to all the @TeamKujira applications. @unstake_fi - The instant unstaking tool for the @cosmos interchain.  Other teams building on @TeamKujira: @AQLA_Token - The #RWA project focussing on carbon credits. @Fuzion_App - A team that's working on multiple products. One example is Plasma, the OTC desk on @TeamKujira. @Manta_DAO - @TeamKujira's #DeFi hub.

Self-repaying loans and yield tokenization are two examples of what could be possible. @NamiProtocol - A stablecoin yield aggregator. @BlendProtocol - Allowing anyone to create a basket of assets that can be managed automatically @yieldharbour - The decentralized options trading protocol arriving on @TeamKujira soon  I couldn't be more bullish on @TeamKujira.

833,Altcoin Sherpa,"Why do people like trading vs. just buy and hold?  A few reasons IMO:  it feels like you're actively making money and can 'pay yourself'.   Ie. you buy $BTC at 40k and you sell it at 42k. You have your principle $ and can cash out the profits to your bank account. You can take that $ and go to the next trade and also make $ actively  It feels much different than if you just buy BTC and hold it for 6 months. Because the trading aspect involves more skill and you can actually reap more rewards (when done correctly).   With that said, it's oftentimes hard to trade in certain conditions AND most people fuck it up. And in super strong bull markets, the majority of participants would probably be better off holding than actively trading.  Still, if you're full time crypto, you've got bills to pay. I get it. You need to make some $ and it feels lame to just buy some random small cap and wait for it to 100x. So you will continue to draw support/resistance lines on the chart and continue to learn.   The general path that I've seen most crypto participants go towards is:  Poor/grinding-> trading a ton, learning the ropes, trying to get any $ you can get, flip around, rotate, etc  Mid rich-> swing trading more, able to hold ideas longer, still have entry/exits, less rotation  Whale-> Less risk overall, happy to just have longer holding periods, maybe shift more to venture, more buy and hold and just go into a coma (aka DegenSpartan).   because the richer you are, the more you are in protection mode vs. pure growth.  I'm not saying you can't be profitable trading. It's much easier in the bull market when easy mode is on and you can simply buy every dip. But with that said, I think that the best path for most people is to just do research, buy some coins in a sector you like (ie. AI), and just hold and do your regular day to day.  But if you're actively in the trenches and actively trading every day because you are a degenerate and fighting with everyone else in the orderbooks...  As a fellow retail trader...

49,WhalePanda,"Classic Dubai Criticism  It's build by slaves The workers, mostly from South East Asia, that come here to work make multiples of what they earn back at home. No their passport doesn't get taken away, no they're not forced to work all day in the heat. The government has worked hard to remove the bad apples, which are everywhere. Most are happy to have the opportunity to work here. They are a vital part of the economy and having them being treated badly would be horrible for the PR.  Women don't have any rights/It's oppressive regime Women have equal rights as men. A lot of people seem to be confusing the UAE with Saudi Arabia. Yes, I am totally fine with my daughter growing up here and she has every opportunity a boy has.  There's no culture! What's culture to you? All movies, ballets, opera, concerts, etc are happening here too. You have a lot of exhibitions and galleries. The boom that Dubai has seen in the last 30 years is incomparable to anything in the west so yes everything is newer. You can still visit old parts too or museums about when it was just a pearl diving village. What you're really saying is that you prefer old buildings. That's cool, I love the architecture in Vienna. Or the old city in Bruges. But there are many aspects of culture and you're just making up things. I'd argue that here they actually are exposed to more culture. My kids have Chinese friends with whom they've celebrated Chinese New Year, they learn about Ramadan, they learn about Diwali.  It's not a democracy! That's true, and you know this before you move. A democracy sounds good on paper but in practice, how is it going in Europe, or in the US? They can't implement long term plans since they only care about power and re-election. A benevolent dictatorship always works way better than any democracy. I know this is going to trigger a lot of people but if you're honest with yourself, you know that this is true. ""But what if this changes"" then you leave, it's as simple as that. No one is going to keep you captive. The rulers of the UAE had a long term vision to implement something like Singapore and attract a lot of foreign investors. You can't successfully implement a long term vision without stability. You don't need to like it, but it's a fact. For example 2 years ago UAE was still using the old Friday/Saturday weekend, which wasn't in line with the rest of the world. The one day beginning of December they said ""ok from the 1st of January the weekend will be Saturday/Sunday like the rest of the world"" to be more business friendly/compatible. Everyone panicked, schools, businesses but guess what, 3 weeks later everyone managed to pull it off. In Europe they've been arguing about daylight savings time for more than 10 years now. Again: I'm not saying it's perfect, far from, but for sure works better than 99% of the democracies out there.  Sharia law/Islam Yes the UAE is a Muslim country and how often do you notice that on a daily basis? Hardly ever. The UAE depends on expats, they need people to come here for both tourism and to live and work here for business. The majority of their income is coming from these sources, not from oil as some might think. They understood this early on and that is why technically they have Sharia law in practice it is very lenient and as open as the west.  Yes, you can buy alcohol here. Not just in restaurants/bars with a liquor license but pretty much every mall now has a liquor store. They recently removed the high taxes on it too (although the hotels still charge the same amount for their drinks)  Yes you can buy pork here. There are special areas (""non-muslim"") in supermarkets where you can get all the bacon or Jamon Iberico that you want.  You can't wear what you want! Yes you can, besides in mosques and government buildings, they're not going to say anything about it. There are signs in the mall that you need to dress modestly, but tbh from what I've seen, anything really goes. That being said if you're man and want to go into an official government building you won't get in in shorts. Long pants are needed.   What about gay people? I know a couple of gay couples that happily live here together for many years.  You can also officially live together without being married.  But I've heard about people getting arrested in the UAE for yelling and swearing. What were they yelling? Were they just being ghetto? Good that they got arrested. Libel laws are quite strong here, something to be mindful of.  Also in the UAE there are 2 genders fwiw.",04/17/2024 11:57 AM,False,69,5,12
50,WhalePanda,"What I don't love about Dubai  Scammers While your traditional crimes aren't that common as in the West, you have a different kind that really is annoying. Everyone at some level is trying to scam you. You have the obvious ones, you get a fake call from ""Dubai police"" or your bank and they try to get information out of you for malicious use. Everyone always tries to make money off of you, start with that assumption and interactions will become a lot easier and clearer. I'm not used to that. I think this also has to do with people not really caring that much about their own reputation. If you build a company in a place where you grew up and lived your entire life, you care a lot more about your reputation. Because Dubai has a lot of people moving in and out of the country, reputation is worth less.  Real estate agents They should go in the same category as scammers tbh. It is very easy to get a realtor license here, no need to take a course, you just need to take an exam and you'll get your license. That means almost everyone can be a realtor, since the real estate market has boomed here like crazy it also means that a lot of shady characters who have a good sales pitch are dominating this part of the economy. They will tell you literally anything to get the sale. ""Of course you can remove that wall"" ""Of course the apartment will be finished and handed over on time"", they just want to close and get their commission. I haven't met a single one yet that I can honestly say I trust and I met many. Never trust a realtor.  Banks First of all despite Dubai putting itself out there as crypto-friendly, the banks are the opposite. You think about sending or receiving money from a crypto exchange, you'll get your bank account closed. I always used a foreign bank to move money in and out and transfer money from there locally. Also the services aren't up to standard with many European/Swiss banks, the only thing that's relatively easy is bank account opening, but since they close bank accounts easily too and for random reasons it's smart to have at least 2-3 at the time.  Road infrastructure It's pretty bad. My wife told me that she read once in a book that ""Dubai's road infrastructure was designed and build by people not living in Dubai"". That's definitely what it feels like. I'm not even talking about the amount of traffic on the road. Dubai, unlike most European cities, has more the American model of ""everyone drives everywhere"" rather than walking. Don't try to walk in Dubai, not because of the weather, but just because it lacks the infrastructure (outside of maybe Downtown and JBR and obviously inside communities itself). In certain places if you miss an exit you need to drive 3-4 kms further to get another exit and drive back. This is not on a highway but in the city. The city has been growing a lot and traffic gets really bad from November till March/April which is the high season especially in Downtown and Marina.  Rain I guess I need to address this now especially after yesterday. When it rains the entire city shuts down. A lot of the older areas are not designed for rain, in the past there were many years without any real rain. This has increased exponentially with cloud seeding. I compare it with Belgium as soon as it snows. No one knows how to drive anymore and work and school become a mess and everyone just stays home. Yesterday's rain was truly exceptional though, it rained 4 times the annual amount in 24 hours.",04/17/2024 09:18 AM,False,87,3,28
51,WhalePanda,Yesterday's ETF flows by @FarsideUK were negative for $58 million.  $GBTC had $79.4 million of outflows. Ark also had outflows again for $12.9 million.  Blackrock only did $25.8 million of inflows.  Price is still ranging in the bottom of the range. Several attempts to break down below $61.5k have been rejected so far.  The halving is happening in 2.5 days from now. Sentiment still quite bad.,04/17/2024 03:53 AM,True,156,24,9
52,WhalePanda,"What I love about Dubai  As soon as someone says he/she likes Dubai you always get the same negative comments so I'll address the less desirable parts in the next part which I will write tomorrow or on Thursday.  No personal income tax Well that's an obvious one and maybe even the number 1 reason why most people move here. They did implement a 9% corporate tax now over $100k profit. They also have 5% VAT. They had to implement taxes to get off the FATF grey list.  Safety Again a very obvious one. When you go to Starbucks you can leave your phone or laptop on a table to reserve the place for yourself without any fear of them getting taken. A woman can walk on the street at night by herself without any worries about getting harassed or worse. No fears of pickpockets or other crimes. You can leave your car unlocked anywhere, most people leave their houses and apartments unlocked. My wife stepped into the wrong car once in a parking lot at a mall and only realized when she tried to start it, it wasn't ours. Does that mean that there's no crime? There is always some crime but most of them are either scams or when it's about burglary/theft usually they get caught. If you commit a crime, you'll get deported.  Education This is from my perspective as someone who's used to public education in Belgium. The schools and facilities are insane. The level of education in the private schools is exceptional, since there are so many new families moving to Dubai there are also a lot of new schools being build and opening up. Everything is brand new and high quality. The school my kids go to now is, in my opinion, super expensive, however I compared it to the school we had picked out in Lugano and from what I've heard from friends in the US... it's still a lot cheaper here for this kind of education. The kids absolutely love it.  Healthcare Again from my perspective as someone who didn't really have private healthcare in Belgium: the level of healthcare here is top notch. No 5-6 months wait for checkups or procedure. Same day if it's really urgent or else for sure within 2-3 days. My son needed braces and that was all done really fast and smooth. In Belgium there are long waitlists for specialized dentists. Private healthcare also means private health insurance and that does get costly too. A Mexican friend had her parents visiting, the mother slipped and fell and broke her wrist. She was taken to the hospital by ambulance, had x-ray taken, cast put on and all that within 1.5 hour and at the end she didn't have to pay anything since it was a medical emergency.  Connectivity I've come to value this even more. Once you go Emirates, you're not going back. Yes, yes there are other premium airlines with similar, or arguably better service but you have to admit that it's great. Direct flights to everywhere in the world, Dubai is an amazing travel hub. I'm not flying to Europe much anymore but taking the kids to Asia and Africa has been simply amazing. All within reasonable flying time and without annoying layovers.  Cultural diversity This one might trigger some people with PTSD. I've met people from all over the world that live here. What happens often, especially in many parts of Europe, if you move there as a foreigner it is extremely hard to integrate into the community. I'll take Belgium as an example: everyone in the area I grew up had the village mentality: you're born, raised, marry, have kids and die in the same place. You make friends in school and those will be your friends for the rest of your life. That's it. 90% immigrants has the advantage that everyone made a big move to move out of their home country. Everyone has a different story and (almost) everyone is quite open and friendly to new people since it takes a lot of courage to make a move like that. People tend to be more open-minded. The downside then is that you have people that are here only for a couple of years. They come here to work, make money and leave. Those friendships aren't long lasting so there's always a coming and going of friends. Another good thing about cultural diversity is that no matter what food you're looking for: you're going to find and since there are so many people from different countries here: it's going to be amazing.",04/16/2024 04:19 PM,False,184,8,29
53,WhalePanda,"Picking the right place to live  I like order and I like lists. I started making a list of my requirements to move to a new country. This is going to be different for pretty much every person and let me start of by saying ""There is no perfect country"".  For me personally the following were the most important requirements: - Safety - Good education - No/low taxes - Good Quality of Life - Good weather  Less important factors still to be considered: - Friendliness to expats - English speaking - No natural disasters (guess this also falls under safety) - Easy to travel to/from - Entertainment for me and the kids  First things first: I didn't want to live in the EU anymore. I feel that the EU is just a ticking time bomb and everything is just getting worse. The only exception to this would've potentially been Madeira. Madeira had a lot of potential but then fell short for me personally in the end.  I've done my research on all Caribbean Islands and while exceptionally beautiful and no taxes there are a lot of other issues there.  So naturally I came to the conclusion to move to... Switzerland. Yeah I didn't even consider Dubai at that time, it felt far away from my family and the weather so I hadn't even given it a proper evaluation at that point.  Switzerland was the logical solution, safe, stable, center of Europe, while outside of the EU. We would still have to pay taxes but that would be possible with a lump sum payment. Cost of living was a concern and the fact that we would have to learn Italian wasn't ideal but better than Belgium for sure. We were actively looking for properties in the Lugano area because weather-wise that's as close to Mediterranean climate as you can get. We found a school, which was very expensive and not perfect but better than the one in Belgium. Told my tax advisor to plan everything for a move to Switzerland. Told my parents we were moving to Switzerland. Everything seemed ready. This was in February-March 2021.  I had planned a beach holiday to Dubai for April 2020. But you know what happened in early 2020, the world shut down and we weren't able to travel. So I had it rescheduled for the Easter break at school for April 2021.  We came to Dubai and loved the holiday. There were so many things to do for both adults and kids. Everything was designed for the heat and indoors, you move from AC to AC when it's hot. We felt safe and during the vacation my wife jokingly said that we should move there instead. All the prejudices of being in a Muslim country just faded away.  When we got back to Belgium I did some more research and it made a lot more sense for us to move to Dubai. No taxes, high quality of life, real estate is way more affordable in Dubai, private school was in English and higher quality and while Lugano is absolutely beautiful... there really isn't that much to do there.",04/16/2024 10:46 AM,False,235,11,46

232,Bruce Fenton,"Land of the Free?  Good morning from Dubai again.   Some people ask how I, as a libertarian ancap who is focused on freedom and human rights, could support Dubai and the UAE.  It‚Äôs precisely because of its excellent human rights achievements that I support the UAE.   It‚Äôs not even close when compared with the USA üá∫üá∏.  UAE üá¶üá™ utterly surpasses the US in human rights in almost every meaningful way.  To quote Sam Jackson:  It ain't the same ballpark, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same sport.   I‚Äôm an expert on both places and on human liberty and freedom.  I‚Äôve lived in both countries.  I‚Äôve studied classic liberalism, free markets and liberty for nearly 20 years. I‚Äôm acutely aware of the many criticisms of the UAE on worker rights, gay rights and other issues. I‚Äôve read, researched and spoken first hand with workers, residents, visitors, government officials and critics & found the majority to be claims to be baseless or false and with others improving.   Neither country is perfect. Both countries have areas they could improve on in human liberty.  But there is simply no comparison.  UAE is *far* more free and has a far better record on human rights in thousands of ways, across the board and in most categories.   The UAE most clearly dominates the US on the most important area of human rights and freedom:  economic freedom and free markets.  Economic freedom is the base for other freedoms and is the primary engine to reduce crime, improve human rights and improve the happiness and quality of life for citizens.  From this base other day to day freedoms flow.  In this regard UAE is a clear winner.  This is why the best and brightest flock here by the thousands: to pursue a better life, better opportunities and to invent, build and create jobs‚Ä¶leaving authoritarian failures like San Francisco to wallow in destruction, depression and filth.   Most Americans live in a propaganda bubble fueled by echos of a long gone past ‚Äî a past where we as a nation respected property rights, our government followed the Constitution, we had a fair and balanced justice system, free speech, free markets, entrepreneurship and the American dream.  But that past just doesn‚Äôt exit anymore.    Those days are long gone and to pretend they are still here ignores the unbelievably serious problems of the USA and dooms us to not fix them.  Tragically, the US is not a free country anymore.  I love my country - but it is deeply broken and in need of major repair.  UAE can continue to improve but it‚Äôs trend is one of improvement not of decline.   For the day to day lives of most people, UAE is a winning model.  The greatest achievements of the UAE over the last 20 years have come from freedom: allowing people to build and live.  I hope the US can learn from its success and embrace our roots of freedom. I pray the US will go back to its greatness, stop being a punchline and once again be a model for the world.  In the meantime, UAE is an obvious choice for those who care about economic and human liberty.",02/02/2024 05:21 AM,True,360,81,67

The Housing Bubble  The ICO Bubble  DeFi Summer  NFTs Craze  Memecoin madness  The list goes on  What if you had the vision to spot these opportunities and capitalize on them?

Avoid accountability, if you lose it is NEVER your fault. Blame influencers, the market makers, bad luck or your girlfriend.  4. Eat junk food, don't workout, and don't meditate.  5. Copy trade influencers. Make sure to have as many opinions as possible (besides your own) before making any decisions.  6. Don't journal trades. Just go with your gut feel, writing is for nerds.  7. Try to figure it all out yourself. Don't look for guidance, in courses, mentors or books.  8. Use as many strategies as possible. Make sure they're as complicated as possible.  9.

Take profit every time total crypto portfolio goes +x%  High risk approach: Take profit when TOTAL portfolio +100%  Low risk: Take profit when TOTAL portfolio goes +15%  Individual trades can still run 10x.  Example: You buy a coin with 5% of portfolio, it goes 10x, that's ~ +50%   Be high risk early and lower risk later in the bull market.  2. I reduce risk every time something really stupid happens.  Example: $30mil sent to a presale address in 1 hour.  Reduce risk means, I target smaller deviations.   E.g instead of +50% I start looking for +30%  3. Always ask ""If the bull market ended tomorrow, would I be fine?""  If the answer to this question is ever no, reposition yourself.  4.

234,Breakout,"FX Prop Is Dying. Join Crypto.  FX currently dominates the prop trading space.  While futures and crypto have seen a modest increase in popularity, FX is the most popular market.  Breakout is a crypto-only prop firm built by crypto native traders, investors, and builders. While we‚Äôre undoubtedly biased on this matter, it is our view that FX traders should consider expanding their trading to include crypto.  The immediate retort might be ‚ÄúBut my FX prop firm also offers crypto!‚Äù  No ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt.  Your FX prop firm likely offers garbled crypto CFDs with wide spreads, archaic listings, and at times even limited trading hours.  Breakout is the first and only prop firm to offer crypto trading with liquidity sourced from a tier 1 centralized exchange (Bybit), 80+ constantly-updated listings, and 24/7 trading. Our pricing and liquidity are derived from Bybit‚Äôs perpetual futures contracts ‚Äì the most liquid and highly-traded instruments in crypto. Breakout is the only firm that is fully in tune with the needs of crypto-native traders, and this involves the ability to list new coins at the same pace as major centralized exchanges.  Trading conditions aside, there are plenty of other reasons why FX traders should consider expanding their trading to include crypto. This article will outline a few of them.  24/7 Trading  Crypto is always available to trade.  No weekends. No public holidays. No obtuse opening and closing hours.  Crypto trades 24/7.  Beyond the convenience factor of always being able to trade a market, 24/7 generally expands the scope of opportunities on any given week to trade, pass an evaluation, and get funded.  5 trading days (with sometimes odd hours) vs 7 trading days (24/7) makes a difference. Especially given that weekends in crypto can be rife with altcoin opportunities and setups that simply do not happen in FX.  Lastly, aside from being closed on the weekend, FX traders have to deal with some form of high impact news almost every week. While this may ordinarily present an opportunity to trade, it is common for FX firms to place restrictions around news trading (if not prohibit it entirely).  Crypto, on the other hand, offers opportunities every day ‚Äì without the ‚Äòhelp‚Äô of an economic calendar.  Higher Volatility  Liquid crypto is a traders‚Äô paradise.  Rather than levering up 1000x to make lunch money from a 0.0001% move in some major currency pair, high market cap high liquidity crypto pairs move 5%-20% in a day quite regularly.  For traders, volatility means opportunity, and crypto is king of that realm.  Rather than levering up and staring at the 1-minute chart to scalp EUR/USD at the open, crypto allows you to quite comfortably day trade and swing trade much larger moves without the need for extremely high leverage or the use of micro time frames.  Fewer Correlations, More Dispersion  While altcoins generally correlate quite positively with BTC (even this has been strained recently), there is a lot of dispersion among altcoins themselves.  This means that out of the dozens of liquid altcoins available in the market ‚Äì with over 80 of them available on Breakout ‚Äì there are plenty of opportunities to trade both directions on any given day.  Rather than having to determine a bias from DXY or EUR/USD, crypto allows you to find uncorrelated coins, isolated moves, narrative-based trades, pair trades, and more.  In general, crypto trading is less ‚Äòtop heavy‚Äô and thus presents a wider range of trade opportunities.  Faster and Wider Swing Trade Opportunities  Swing trading is one of the more popular trading styles in the prop space.  Unlike in FX, where the % moves are much smaller and swings may take weeks and months to resolve on high time frames, crypto swing trades are plentiful and move very quickly ‚Äì especially if the market is at a cyclical turning point.  Additionally, crypto swings tend to be less choppy ‚Äì if your timing is right at a key inflection point, the market generally wastes no time in moving in your favor and it does so quickly.  These swings either validate or invalidate your ideas pretty quickly, meaning less time lost to ambiguous chop while you sit in a trade whose outcome is still unclear weeks (potentially even months) down the line.  New Coins, New Opportunities  Crypto is predicated on innovation.  As a result, it is common to see many new coins become popular ‚Äì especially if the market is hot.  These coins are unburdened by historic holders looking to unload, and newer participants do not have past price action to anchor their views. Additionally, newer traders generally flock towards these new listings, which generally makes for much ‚Äòcleaner‚Äô price action.  Given these new opportunities are often retail-heavy, basic price action, patterns, and technical indicators are more reliable as 1) the valuation of something new is a tricky exercise; and 2) those are primarily the tools used by newer traders, thus creating an order herding effect.  In summary, new listings entail more opportunities.  Fewer Sophisticated Market Participants  Crypto attracts many first-time market participants, for whom trading these markets is their first foray into speculation.  Candidly, this means less sophistication, more inefficiencies, and more opportunities for good trades.  This is similar to the idea of table selection in poker: if you want to do well, you‚Äôre probably not going to pick the table with the sharks if you can avoid it.  As per the previous point, especially on newer coins, the types of participants are both relatively new to markets while also being technical analysis-focused. In essence, this means you‚Äôll be trading against on average less experienced traders using straightforward TA and indicator signals, which are easy to identify and take advantage of.  Compared to the funds and desks managing hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars in FX, your counterparties in crypto are (on average) less experienced and the trading environment is less competitive on the whole.  Summary  The preceding list inexhaustive. There are plenty of other reasons to trade crypto.  Honorable mentions go to seamlessly integrated payment options all done via crypto, the availability of level 2 data at either low or no cost, and the regulatory and operational uncertainties that appear to be plaguing FX firms across the board.  In any case, we hope you are at least interested in trying crypto trading.  Breakout is the best place to do so ‚Äì the first and only prop firm with transparent and verifiable centralized exchange pricing and liquidity, built by crypto natives, and a proud 0 payout denials as part of our track record.

277,Breakout,"We are making 2 changes to the Breakout trading experience.  1. Switching Steps  Previously, traders were required to gain 10% in the first step of the Breakout Evaluation and gain 5% in the second step in order to gain access to a Breakout Account.  These steps have now been reversed: step 1 will be the easier step (5% account gain) and step 2 will be the more difficult step (10% account gain).  This should provide a more intuitive trading experience, as the easier step will come first as traders become acquainted with our platform.  2. Adding an Effective Funding Rate  Breakout is the only prop firm offering a centralized exchange-like trading experience. We source our liquidity from Bybit's perpetual futures.  A core component of trading perpetual futures, especially in these market conditions, is the funding rate i.e. the fee you pay/receive for holding an open position.  On account of current market conditions, we're adding an effective funding rate to all instruments.  Traders will be charged 9 basis points (0.09%) per open position per day on the notional value of the trade, irrespective of direction (long/short). This reflects the 3 basis points (or higher) every 8 hours that traders are paying on centralized exchanges. The effective funding rate will be deducted from your account at the daily close i.e. 0000 UTC.  This change will bring us even closer in line with a crypto native centralized exchange trading experience, and also smoothen our transition to routing Breakout Account trades to the live market (more on that soon).  ü´°",03/25/2024 04:55 PM,True,54,7,15

410,Cred,"A few common mistakes in these conditions:  1. Excessive leverage. Specifically, introducing liquidation risk in assets that are regularly moving 10%-20%+ in a day. Let the volatility do the heavy lifting, not the leverage (or specifically, massively inflated position sizes facilitated by leverage that force you to use very tight stops or liquidate you on small moves against you).  2. Excessively tight stops. Same consideration. If you're targeting larger rotations in a higher volatility asset, being overly tight with stop placement can work against you. You don't want to create a loop where your idea is broadly correct, you get wicked out because you were LARPing as some 50R tick sniper, and then the market moves straight to your target without you.  3. Excessive rotation. If you're trying to make the most of a multi-week and multi-month trending period, you shouldn't be overly concerned with any specific 24H window of returns. It is a form of overtrading. It is also a form of FOMO. This also introduces the risk of creating a loop whereby you sell your bags to chase the strong stuff --> strong stuff consolidates --> the bags you sold moon --> repeat ad infinitum. Find some setups or ideas that you like and give them some room to breathe.  4. Mistaking consolidation for weakness. This is another version of time-based FOMO. Participants will infer that just because their bags haven't turbo mooned in a short period of time, the market is weak or they've allocated poorly. Instead, your rebuttable presumption should be that consolidations are a form of pullback and present an opportunity to buy stuff that eluded you when it was breaking out. Boredom and impatience do not necessarily signal weakness.  5. Excessive trade management. The degree to which you intervene in your trade ideas should somewhat mirror the time frames of those ideas. For example, if your trade is predicated on a breakout from a multi-week range, your targets and trade management time frames should be derived from (or resemble) the weekly time frame. That makes more sense than, for example, buying a large weekly breakout and setting a target at 15M resistance that's 5% higher and panicking over every red 5M candle.  6. Overtrading your core holdings. There are countless stories of traders getting very good swing and/or HTF positional entries but gradually fumbling them through trying to time every single dip and rotation that takes place on the way to their target. An unfortunately common version of this is selling 100% of exposure at some level in order to 'buy back lower'. This is particularly a strange choice when a trader's target is materially higher than the pullback they're hoping to rebuy. For example, if your ultimate target is 50% higher, is it worth selling all of your exposure in an attempt to time a 5%-10% dip? This can result in the market not offering the pullback that was hoped for, and now the trader is sidelined - this usually comes with a mental block, as buying back higher than you sold can be psychologically tricky/feels like you're chasing. In short, this is a form of overoptimisation. If you're bored and feel like gambling in between, use a sub account or @breakoutprop (disclaimer: I have a financial interest in its success) so you can scratch the trading itch without sabotaging yourself. Or go to the casino, get a hobby, whatever.  7. Excessive number of open positions. With every added position, your capacity to effectively manage any single position decreases. The altcoin market is still pretty tightly positively correlated, so you're more likely just spreading yourself thin rather than 'diversifying'. Focusing on a smaller number of higher conviction trade ideas and managing them patiently and judiciously is probably better than trying to catch everything at once and drowning in noise. If you want to spread yourself thin, go buy some Solana shitter lottery tickets i.e. X amount of $ across [large number] of memecoins/new coins that will either go to 0 or appear on your feed when you're up multiples. At least that doesn't take up your trade management RAM.  8. Allowing social media to materially impact your perception. It's PnL + leaderboard season. It may feel like absolutely everyone is winning massively all the time. Granted, the market has been very good unless you've been stubbornly short, but social media is still a highlight reel boosted by selection bias and survivorship bias. You don't see the fumbled entries, the break evens, the times traders got stopped at the bottom, undersizing great ideas and oversizing bad ideas, not pulling the trigger, and so on. As long as you're trading well and improving, don't try to speed run some arbitrary returns or net worth goal.  TL;DR I ain't reading all that. I'm happy for u tho.

69,Justin Banon - @BosonProtocol @FermionProtocol,"Years ago I headed-up a company digitizing physical products and services in travel (like lounge visits, duty free and fast track) and selling them to businesses including banks.  When I joined the game was: how many banks can we acquire?  It was a race between us and a bunch of competitors.  It was hard- like digging a trench.  I changed the strategy.  Instead of competing for the banks' business directly, we targeted payment networks.  We signed global deals with Mastercard, Visa, Amex, Diners, JCB and tied-up thousands of their banks worldwide with just a handful of global contracts.  We grew the business from $50m to $1Bn pa revenues, took >90% market share, and left the competitors with scraps. This is the power of scaled distribution channels.  Now, with @BosonProtocol we are tokenizing (instead of digitizing) physical products, and once again I am implementing a scaled distribution channels strategy. With @WooCommerce we connect with the largest number of e-commerce stores worldwide: 4m!  Each of these sellers can now easily integrate Web3 Commerce directly into their Woo store via the Boson x Woo app.  All this in perfect timing for the new bull run.  Like I said many times- we kept our powder dry.  No point co-launching this with Woo during the crypto winter.  Soon there will be millions of new crypto-savvy customers and trillions of dollars of value in crypto.  Boson x Woo will be a key offramp from crypto to commerce without touching tradfi. üß®üí•",04/16/2024 02:45 PM,True,89,25,16

112,SmarDex.io,"Current status and announcement :  Hello everyone,  Thanks again for your increased patience regarding USDN!  As you know, our priority is always to release flawless products of the highest possible quality.  After more than a year of research, we started working on implementing our USDN solution in July 2023. The number of challenges we had to solve was impressive, and our team succeeded in surpassing every milestone. This is a great source of pride for us, and has made us understand why no one has ever succeeded in creating a decentralized synthetic dollar. USDN is more than that.  We've recently added a few extra security measures and some extremely innovative functions to enable the protocol to be even more efficient in its liquidity management. This has made development a little longer, and we're confident that we'll be entering the final audit phase in 2-3 weeks' time.  In the meantime, here are some long-awaited details on USDN related to $SDEX:  ‚Ä¢ For each USDN minting; a few SDEX will be purchased by the user who will burn them forever. This means that the SDEX price will definitely rise a little more for each new mint.  ‚Ä¢ TVL will generate strong buying pressure on SDEX. Let's say the TVL of $USDN is 1 billion. Taking the state of the average market over the last few years and extrapolating to the future, this would generate around $600,000 worth of SDEX bought and burned every month (at current prices, this represents around 35,000,000 SDEX). These purchases would take place automatically, recurrently and perpetually, for as long as the blockchain exists. Growth is linear. For example, if USDN reaches the current TVL of Ethena USDe (which is a fully centralized Delta Neutral synthetic dollar attempt that we deem suboptimal, risky and vulnerable for reasons we'll detail later), that would be $1,440,000 of SDEX that would be bought per month on the pools and then burned forever.  It's up to you if you want to take a look at the impact on SDEX prices of this kind of automatic, recurring purchase.  We'll be sharing many more details with you over the coming weeks, and thank you again for your attention and patience. We're proud and honored to be supported by such a great community.

223,0 Knowledge Network,"Is Your VPN Truly Keeping You Private? ü§î  Have you ever wondered if your VPN is as secure as it claims?  Journey with us as we uncover the truth about VPNs and introduce you to the unparalleled privacy of 0KN.  Let‚Äôs unravel the privacy puzzle together üßµ  üõ°Ô∏è Understanding VPNs  It‚Äôs a service that encrypts your internet data and sends it through a secure tunnel to a server.  This helps you browse privately ‚Äî at least on the surface.  But beneath this, the VPN‚Äôs centralized control poses risks you should know about.  üîì The Myth of Total VPN Privacy  VPNs claim to offer anonymity, but they actually have a central point of control.  Many VPN providers have the capability to track and log your browsing habits.  This data could be exposed to third parties, compromising your privacy.  üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è VPN Limitations Unveiled  Even with a VPN, complete privacy is a myth.  Techniques like browser fingerprinting can bypass VPN encryption, tracking your online habits.  Plus, VPNs can‚Äôt protect you from malware or phishing ‚Äî other critical threats to your digital safety.  üìä VPNs and Metadata Analysis  The metadata in your VPN-encrypted traffic can reveal patterns that may be traced back to you.  Skilled analysts can use this data to infer who you are and what you‚Äôre doing online.  It‚Äôs a vulnerability that many don‚Äôt expect from VPNs.  üîó 0KN: A New Kind of Network  Enter 0KN ‚Äî a network where decentralized security is the norm, not the exception.  The network doesn‚Äôt funnel your data through central points; instead, it is encrypted and distributed across a network of nodes to secure communications with privacy-enhanced applications.  This structure removes the privacy risks in centralized VPNs for use cases requiring strong anonymity.  üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Power of Zero Knowledge Proofs  Imagine proving something without revealing the secret itself ‚Äî that‚Äôs what Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) do.  0KN‚Äôs decentralized apps use ZKPs to validate smart contract interactions without ever needing to access the actual data.  üîë Privacy by Default with 0KN  Your interactions on 0KN are more than secure. They‚Äôre private by design.  Every piece of data is anonymized, and your identity is shielded, even from the network itself.  üåê Why Choose 0KN?  With 0KN, you‚Äôre not just another user in the crowd.  We ensure that every stakeholder, node, and user plays a pivotal role without compromising their data privacy.  It‚Äôs a network built for you, secured by you.  üîç Embracing Next-Gen Privacy  VPNs might offer some level of privacy, but they fall short of providing the comprehensive, built-in security that 0KN provides for decentralized apps even under full network surveillance.  With 0KN, you‚Äôre part of a privacy-focused ecosystem where your data and contributions drive a secured digital future.  Curious about a future where privacy is the default?  Follow @0Knowledge_net  Here, privacy is a shared mission, not just a service.  #0KN #Privacy #VPN",04/18/2024 07:32 PM,True,394,116,66

173,That Martini Guy,"#Bitcoin Halving is not a ‚ÄúBuy the rumour, Sell the news‚Äù Event.  It is a change in the maths on how Bitcoin works  It means fundamentally the price has to increase because miners now earn 50% less than yesterday  Now miners increase hash power to make as much as they did before  This increases Bitcoin mining difficulty making it more difficult to mine a block of Bitcoin  This increases the cost of mining so miners again have to increase hash power  It is an up only trajectory.  There is absolutely no reason we will not see +$500,000 Bitcoin in the next 12 months.  The maths says it is more than possible. It is probable.  Combine the reduction in mining supply with the ever decreasing liquidity Bitcoin has with exchange reserves ever decreasing.  We end up with a scenario called a supply squeeze.  This is when there is not enough Bitcoin being emitted into the system to accommodate all demand for Bitcoin.  When demand is outstripping supply and the network is growing at a faster and faster pace. This creates a scenario where Bitcoin will far surpass $500,000 per coin.  $1,000,000 Bitcoin is coming.

110,Stack Hodler,"The Yen carry trade is blowing up in front of us and #Bitcoin is trading above $71,000  Few understand this (mainly because it's nerdy as hell)  But it's a big deal.  And every investor should at least kind of get it to grasp what's really going on with their portfolio.  In simple terms: Japan has kept interest rates artificially super low for over a decade.   Even lower than the US and Europe.  That forced Japanese investors to invest overseas to seek better returns.  Over $3 Trillion found its way into overseas markets, pumping up asset prices and keeping US and EU borrowing costs artificially low as they happily deficit spent.  What were the Japanese investors buying?  Mainly US and European bonds to get better yields than they could get at home.  But since they live in Japan, they care about their returns in Yen terms - not dollar or euro terms.  So they had to hedge their foreign investments to protect themselves in the case of currency volatility.  Why?  Because if you buy a European bond and the Euro suddenly crashes vs the Yen, you could end up losing in Yen terms.  So you buy some insurance for that scenario and pay a premium to protect against that risk.  That works fine until Yen volatility increases.  Which is exactly what is happening now:  As currency volatility increases, the insurance to protect against it gets more expensive.  The insurance starts to eat into the returns you could get by holding US and EU bonds.  So what do you do?   You sell the foreign bonds when they no longer earn you more than holding a Japanese bond.  And if the Japanese bond yields are rising, then that also increases their relative attractiveness.  Which is ALSO happening now, and needs to happen even more to protect the Yen from devaluing too much.  Japanese bond yields are surging towards decade+ highs as I type this:  This is why people care about the Yen and Japanese government bonds.  When Yen volatility rises and Japanese government bond yields rise, investment capital flows out of US and EU bonds and back into Japan.  When investment capital flows out of US and EU bonds, then US and EU bond yields rise.  When those yields rise, highly indebted governments (like the US) start to look even more insolvent than they already look.  Why?  Because higher yields mean higher interest payments on the debt in the near future.  And considering the US is already deficit spending trillions of dollars, those interest payments can only be paid with more borrowed money.  Borrowing more money increases the bond supply, which sends yields even higher.   Which increases the interest payments further, and increases the need for the government to borrow.  Starting to make sense? It's a vicious feedback loop.  So what's the solution?   There's only one solution: When debt becomes impossible to pay in real terms, governments debase their currency to pay it in nominal terms.  And that's why this is tied to #Bitcoin   The fact that Bitcoin is rising over $70K as global bond yields once again surge indicates the market understands that higher yields simply means the timeline for currency debasement is accelerating.  It's an open secret that the fiat endgame is massive currency devaluations.  It's already happening (that's why all assets are sitting near highs), but it can accelerate.  It's all a big game of musical chairs, and investors are becoming increasingly aware that there are only 21 million seats.  When a wave of debasement hits, you want to be holding the hardest assets you can find.  And finite Bitcoin is the hardest asset.  With the recent push by BlackRock, it is increasingly perceived as the Ark for the coming fiat flood.  But there's still plenty of room left on the Ark.  So you might want to secure a seat just in case.",04/11/2024 09:48 AM,True,5715,1250,489

449,Marc van der Chijs,"I spent some time analyzing the post-ETF Bitcoin charts today and came up with some rough price predictions for the next 3 months. Currently the ETF inflows lead to a 2% increase in price per day, which is about $1000 per day. Most of the increase is taking place during the settlement period before US market opening.   It seems to me that you can trade that ‚Äòmarket inefficiency‚Äô, but I am not a day trader. More important, I believe you can predict this daily price increase by looking at the inflows that are announced a few hours before that.  At current prices inflows are 10-12 times of newly created BTC, meaning that people have to sell their BTC in order to fill the ETF orders. They will only do that at higher prices, because hardly anybody who looks at this market would think BTC is peaking. Higher prices lead to more FOMO among ETF investors, leading to more demand and even higher prices.  Two other events that will happen in the next 3 months are important: 1) The halving of the BTC mining rewards in mid April. Right now 900 BTC are produced per day, but after that only 450 new coins are mined. This will add to the supply shock and will lead to even higher prices 2) Many financial advisors can only start selling a new ETF after 90 days of trading (to minimize  the risk that an ETF they sell will fail), meaning by early May demand should start picking up even more.  What will this mean for the price? I think we are in uncharted territory here, but I believe an average increase of $1000 per trading day over the next weeks is very likely. After the 2 events above this could even be substantially higher. This means that unless there is a black swan event we will see a new all time high (>$69K) before the halving and we could possibly hit $100K in the next 2-3 months already.",02/15/2024 01:49 AM,True,3208,619,208

Not Bits vs Sats.  1 BTC =1,000,000 bits  1 bit = 100 sats  So a bit is like a dollar and a sat is like a cent.  Or a bit is like a pound and a sat is like a penny.  Instead of something being 30,000 sats (who describes something as 30,000 cents?) it‚Äôs 300.00 bits or 300 bits.  24999 sats is 249 bits and 99 sats or 249.99  This is not a new construct.

The APs can then sell the new ETF units into the market and make profits, because the ETF is trading at a premium   If the ETF is trading at a discount, the reverse happens. The APs buy ETF units in the market, provide them to the issuer and then receive the underlying assets. The underlying assets are then sold, generating profits, since the product was trading at a discount   Crucially there should be multiple competing APs. This ensures the product can handle large flows and has low tracking error  By only allowing only cash creations and redemptions, much of the benefits of the ETF structure are lost.

Come join us on the bitcoin front‚Äîwe have a lot to give, yes, but we need you, too.  You see we‚Äôre approaching a battle of the ages here. One that will likely involve bank runs, devaluations, and wars in the West. A conflict whose outcomes will certainly impact the lives of our children and many generations after. And for that years‚Äô long struggle our world needs all the help it can get.  I have a lot of sympathy for people suffering from behavioral addictions and general lack of impulse control‚ÄîI struggle with this still myself. In fact I believe addiction is the dominant challenge of our current era, co-created by the fiat system which drastically reduces the rewards people can earn from deferral of gratification and a virtuous life in general.  But this is not the place to get in the intellectual weeds.   I‚Äôm just here to send you, to the best of my ability, a warm invitation to try and clean up your life. I‚Äôm here to remind you that the world is worth it, and to valiantly assure you that you are worth it.  So get yourself to a meeting (yes the one you‚Äôve been telling yourself you don‚Äôt need), pick up that book you bookmarked a while ago, ask someone for advice or support, cue up that meditation podcast, walk a dog, go on a walk in nature, or take a cold shower for 30 seconds. I suggest beginning small, so small that you can take that first step right now.  We‚Äôre all going to die one day. You know it, and deep down you also know what kind of life will make you feel proud to have lived. Sure, you can keep trying to get that chuckle out of other degen traders, and get on a little buzz by setting up that 10x leveraged play, but deep down you know that is just a poor surrogate for making a real connection with yourself and the rest of this world.  Here is the good news: once you start walking the path towards the good life (not as in hedonism but as in doing the right thing), you will, little by little, start noticing that you are in fact not alone, that in fact we are all in this together. You‚Äôll start developing friendships and rekindling old ones that you‚Äôd forgotten you lost. And, paradoxically, as you slowly face your fears of ‚Äúnot having enough‚Äù head on, you‚Äôll realize you already have so much to be grateful for, and you‚Äôll start to feel happier than you‚Äôve ever been.  Help yourself, you‚Äôre worth it! Under that thin cynical veneer, a truly beautiful person resides. That person knows in his bones that this little planet, with all its male and female silliness, with its songs of pain and sorrow, this blue-green-orange place teeming with life, is surely worth it too. Your possible reaction to this paragraph, that ‚Äúmeh‚Ä¶‚Äù or eye rolling part of you, that‚Äôs not all of you, that‚Äôs not who you are deep down. There is wonder in you, and joy, and a thirst for worthwhile adventure. If you can‚Äôt feel it, it doesn‚Äôt mean the sun isn‚Äôt there for you, but just that there‚Äôs clouds hanging out in your sky. An ominous sky makes place for a cheerful one, over time but inevitably, once one starts walking the path of the good life.  So join us my friend.

If you want to invest, BUY BITCOIN.",12/13/2023 11:11 PM,False,349,61,35
743,Liquid Network üåä,"Under the high-fee market, there has been a renewed interest in second layers, resulting in an increased usage and adoption of Liquid üåä. Many are now leveraging Liquid‚Äôs cheap fees and faster one-minute block times to stack cheap sats and HODL in the mid-term, using it as a bridge to Lightning‚ö°Ô∏èwithout having to use the mainchain (see @Boltzhq and @PeerswapLN today).  With that adoption, a number of new users are grappling with understanding the tradeoffs Liquid makes‚Äìso we thought we would address some of their questions.  ‚ÄúLiquid is centralized‚Äù  Liquid is distributed but is not fully permissionless like #Bitcoin. Today, Liquid is governed by a geographically and geopolitically-distributed federation of more than 65 Bitcoin-centric companies (https://liquid.net/). Within these members are a subset (we call them functionary operators) who run specialized hardware (functionaries). The functionaries propose and sign the blocks that require 2/3rds + 1 (or 11-of-15) of them to approve.  Compromising the Federation's multisig wallet would require commandeering 11 separate functionaries around the world while remaining undetected or for 11-of-15 functionary operators to be dishonest and collude‚Äìagainst their incentives as contributing members of Liquid.üåäüåé   We have plans to increase the number of functionaries with DynaFed, which went live on Liquid in 2022, and with potentially new signature schemes like ROAST, which can help us further Liquid‚Äôs overall decentralization without network disruption.  ‚ÄúWhy L-BTC? Why a federation?‚Äù  Liquid has no separate altcoin, pre-mine or ICO. The native coin of Liquid is BTC! We opt to use a federated two-way peg model (with pegged BTC‚Äîcalled L-BTC‚Äîas the underlying coin), which still provides some decentralization and protection from a single point of failure and is more scalable. This is the tradeoff for not wanting to issue a separate Proof-of-Stake (PoS) governance token that we believe would encourage dishonest participation and take away from Bitcoin network effects.   We believe altcoins generally‚Äîand more so with premines‚Äîinherently create conflicts of interest, distorting participant behavior to gaming other participants. People frequently ask if they can invest in Liquid (they mean to buy a pre-mined token or altcoin), but like Lightning, Liquid has none‚Äîthe native currency IS BTC. If you want to invest, BUY BITCOIN.  Another reason we chose the federated model is that it did not require any changes to be made to Bitcoin itself, something other layer-2 proposals require first. This not only allowed us to build and experiment without constraints right out the gate but, more importantly, the federated model did not impose any risk to Bitcoin‚Äôs own consensus and incentive model.  ‚ÄúSeriously, why the two-way peg though? Aren‚Äôt there alternatives?‚Äù  There is still no generic approach to delivering trustless, two-way pegged sidechains. Solutions must consider tradeoffs between security, features provided, and the impact they might have on the Bitcoin mainchain. A sidechain that requires coupling to the mainchain may expose the incentives of the mainchain to unknown attack vectors and may lead to remedial soft forks.  A federated peg model may not be as permissionless as other solutions, but it has the benefit of being isolated from Bitcoin in its implementation; plus, the use of strong federations establishes a security profile that is suitable for many applications.  We consider a federated approach to pegged sidechains as a sound alternative to solutions that either require a centralized counterparty, an altcoin, or changes to Bitcoin itself. The increased trust requirements necessitated by the federated model are a risk assumed by sidechain users alone, and place no extra burden on users of the mainchain.  ‚ÄúFees go to Blockstream‚Äù   Blockstream‚Äôs role in Liquid is purely as a technical provider to the federation; Liquid‚Äôs governance technology board requests software features and fixes for the functionary software and ultimately evaluates whether to adopt any changes.  As the technical provider of Liquid, one of Blockstream‚Äôs duties is to maintain the fee wallet; however, the fees ultimately belong to the federation. Blockstream only administers them, burning them as needed for sweeps and peg-outs‚Äìthe rest remains untouched. The fee wallet is viewable and can be audited here: https://blockstream.info/liquid/address/QLFdUboUPJnUzvsXKu83hUtrQ1DuxyggRg  It‚Äôs additionally important to note that the 15 functionaries, not Blockstream, control the bitcoin (11-of-15) multisignature wallet and the wallet can be viewed here: https://blockstream.info/address/bc1qxvay4an52gcghxq5lavact7r6qe9l4laedsazz8fj2ee2cy47tlqff4aj4  ‚ÄúWhat are Confidential Transactions?‚Äù  Liquid's Confidential Transactions (CT) feature blind transaction amounts and asset types. This makes selectively not processing certain transactions difficult as the information to distinguish is hidden and available only to the sender and receiver end to end securely.   We believe the lack of on-chain confidentiality on competing platforms is a major liability for serious investors and companies, allowing for the possibility of front-running that disregards the overall protection of one‚Äôs financial privacy.  Longer term, there is some research being done with schemes like Bulletproofs++ (https://blog.blockstream.com/bulletproofs-a-step-towards-fully-anonymous-transactions-with-multiple-asset-types/) that could potentially improve this confidentiality aspect.  We‚Äôve only covered a few key points, but we encourage those who would like to learn more about Liquid‚Äôs federated sidechain model, how it can bring new features to Bitcoin, and the tradeoffs it makes to read the post here: https://blog.liquid.net/the-truth-about-liquid/  We also invite you to join us on the Liquid Community Telegram group for any specific questions and for further dialogue, we're happy to have you!: https://t.me/liquid_community",12/13/2023 11:00 PM,True,479,180,47

773,MacroScope,"Last week, I flew from New York's JFK Airport to El¬†Salvador. Here's what happened during my trip.  Because of Bitcoin, I've been reading about the country and decided to visit. More on Bitcoin in a minute. I'll also comment on the topic of safety. First, here's a takeaway from what I saw:  If I was an investor looking internationally for on-the-ground opportunities, I would immediately get an office in the capital, San¬†Salvador,¬†and look for ways to put money in the country -- by either starting a new business and employing¬†Salvadorans, or backing an existing business. Multiple sectors are growing fast including tourism, hospitality and real estate. The opportunities seem huge.  I stayed a week in San Salvador and in El Zonte (""Bitcoin Beach"").¬†The first impression is at the airport, which is modern and efficient. Because of a delay in New¬†York, my flight arrived in El Salvador a few hours late. But my hotel driver was there. He had¬†been patiently keeping watch for me, and he was smiling as he held up a sign with my name on it. This was my introduction to the country, and it turned out to be representative of what I would experience during my visit. The people are friendly, hard working, proud, entrepreneurial, and family-oriented.  You quickly notice that new construction and infrastructure improvements are happening everywhere. I was struck by how the¬†construction workers seemed to be working very hard. You get the sense that this is a country on the move, and it's easy to see why El Salvador's financial situation has improved. The country's sovereign bonds have seen huge returns recently, and institutional¬†investors should continue to watch for opportunities to allocate here.  The goal in El Salvador seems to be a Latin American version of Singapore: business-friendly, growth-oriented, and tough on crime. Based on what I saw during my visit, this is achievable and they are making progress. Remember, Singapore wasn't always the type of country it is now -- far from it, in fact. It first needed the right policies and leadership. And by the way, I don't remember seeing the international media criticize Singapore for being tough on crime.  Regarding safety, I felt totally safe and relaxed at all times in El¬†Salvador -- much safer than even the best areas of New York City these¬†days. The police and private security guards are everywhere and they are professional, courteous, vigilant¬†and tough. You do not want to be a criminal here. But it was not always this way. I had an interesting conversation with a young man working in a small shop. He said before the¬†crackdown on gangs, much of the¬†money he earned had to be paid to the bad guys, so it was almost pointless to own or start a business. I asked him where the gang members are now. His reply: ""Dead or in jail."" During this trip, I developed a special contempt for people in North America and elsewhere who scold¬†other countries for cleaning up crime while their own cities collapse around them.  If there is something to¬†keep an eye¬†on, it's that President Bukele and his ""new ideas"" policies are clearly very important for continued progress. Bukele is hugely popular and viewed by many as a national hero, so it seems assured that the current progress will continue after the upcoming election. El¬†Salvador's continued stability and future prosperity is important for the United States, and as a U.S. citizen I believe we should be doing everything possible to be a strong ally and support the country's current direction.  Regarding Bitcoin, it's part of El Salvador's policy of ""new ideas."" During my visit, I realized that news reports about how much the country has gained or lost on BTC are ridiculous. Bitcoin has more than paid for itself. Without the country's adoption of Bitcoin, I would not have visited, nor would many others. But Bitcoin's benefits are not just about more tourism.¬†It's part of a broader holistic education about computers, technology, finance, and personal growth and independence.¬†(And I think this is a good narrative to use for Bitcoin as its adoption continues to spread globally.) Young people here are learning about Bitcoin.¬†In coming years, they will have the knowledge and skills to get good jobs working for companies or start their¬†own tech-related¬†businesses. The introduction of Bitcoin by Bukele is probably one of the smartest socio-economic moves any country has ever made,¬†and it will continue to pay dividends in various¬†ways for¬†years to¬†come. Other¬†countries should learn from this and do the same.  Regarding young people and education, I toured the new national library in San Salvador, which is very impressive. Afterwards I asked myself: Do we still have the vision and willpower to build these types of public facilities in the US? I wonder about that.  I know this twitter account has many readers who work in the financial sector, especially in New York. I encourage you to put El Salvador on your travel list. You'll find the economic development story interesting (historically, it's rare to be able to witness this type¬†of national transformation as it's happening) and the¬†authenticity is a wonderful change from Wall Street and its¬†favorite vacation spots. You can get a direct flight in the morning and be on the beach or looking at a volcano that¬†afternoon. Before you go, it's important to understand that this is not the Bahamas or the Hamptons (and guys, how many times can you visit those places?). It's unpretentious, raw and organic -- great food and coffee, surfing, and wild natural beauty. As for San Salvador, it's bustling and busy with upscale shopping and restaurants, and big hotels as well as leafy, quieter places to stay.  This was my¬†first visit to¬†Latin America, and I don't speak Spanish, but everyone was smiling and helpful. I gave generous tips to anyone who helped me -- drivers, waiters, hotel staff -- and they were all very grateful. If you go, you should do the same. Be a good¬†visitor. They're trying hard.  As someone who remembers the news headlines about El¬†Salvador going back 40 years, I never imagined myself making this trip, and it felt a bit surreal to be there. But what's happening is not only a national transformation, it's a story about human perseverance and triumph despite a tough¬†history. We should be cheering them on.  I look forward to returning.",12/03/2023 03:25 AM,True,7249,1454,528

801,Peter Van Valkenburgh,"It‚Äôs time to have the conversation: Is the Bank Secrecy Act unconstitutional? Beyond the speech and privacy issues, the BSA is a sweeping delegation of law making power. Today we're publishing a new report explaining in detail why that's a problem.  üìúFull report is linked in the next tweet, but in a nutshell, the BSA is an incredibly broad law that criminalizes everyday life. As our report explains, breadth rather than ambiguity is the main problem with the statutory text. Take, for example, the money transmission definition:   ""the problem is not that the definition of 'money transmitter' is uncertain. The problem is that, taken seriously, the definition would convert every paid or paying American into a 'financial institution' and obligate each of us to register with the federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as such, keep extensive records of all transactions, robustly identify all transactional counterparties, and regularly report any suspicious dealings we have had with other Americans or foreign persons. And we must do all of that on penalty of felony conviction, severe fines, and jail time.""  That's just the plain language interpretation of the relevant provisions. In practice that absurd breadth gets narrowed by regulatory opinion and the courts:  ""In actual practice no one reads the definition of financial institution as encompassing every paid or paying American. Instead, ambiguity in the definition is invented as a remedy to the statute‚Äôs breadth.""  But this selective narrowing contradicts the plain meaning of the text and also enables endless discretion to choose when to enforce the law and when to not. The result is bad for the predictability of the law and bad for fair and evenhanded enforcement. It raises topical jurisprudential questions involving the major questions doctrine and whether the Court should apply substantive canons of construction like lenity or constitutional avoidance. As judges faced with these issues have said:  ""Although this court, like all other institutions of the United States, is supportive of the law enforcement goals of the government and society, we cannot engage in unprincipled interpretation of the law, lest we foment lawlessness instead of compliance.""  By looking through rulemakings and congressional hearings across the last 30 years we come to a startling conclusion: the statute doesn't actually give the Treasury the authority it has used to selectively narrow the definition through interpretation. Instead, and even more problematically from a constitutional separation of powers standpoint, the statute simply delegates a naked power to enforce or not enforce the law to Treasury and does so without any intelligible principle.   ‚öñÔ∏èThat brings us to the nondelegation doctrine. As Justice Gorsuch has emphasized in recent opinions, Congress not the executive branch is empowered by our constitution to make laws. As we find in the context of the BSA:   ""Throughout this report we have recounted all the many ways that the Bank Secrecy Act, owing to its incredible breadth, has been interpreted and reinterpreted, expanded and contracted by the courts and by FinCEN. Often these have been good and necessary decisions made to avoid over-application of a dangerously invasive warrantless surveillance regime, to literally prevent our otherwise inevitable drift towards a society where everyone is obligated to spy-on and rat-out everyone else. These are not, however, factual findings. These are not decisions made according to some limiting and sensible criteria set out in the statute. These are policy judgements of serious gravity and they‚Äôve been made by the executive branch with powers unconstitutionally delegated.""  Are you a big con-law nerd?

25,Colin Talks Crypto ü™ô,"One of the biggest lies that was pushed upon the bitcoin community was that ‚Äúbitcoin can‚Äôt scale without sacrificing decentralization‚Äù.  I see people regurgitating this left and right. This was apparently a highly effective lie.  This lie was pushed by corrupted developers who were paid by Big Banks to stifle Bitcoin. I know it sounds crazy, but it's true. You can see who paid their salaries here (read the entire thread and all supporting links/videos): https://x.com/ColinTCrypto/status/1656500956136189952  This lie was spread intentionally through the use of mass censorship and social media engineering many years ago (much in the same manner that we see heavily employed today on topics such as world politics and health). You can read about this corruption of bitcoin development in the following thread (make sure to scroll down to read the full thread and read/watch all supporting links) here: https://x.com/ColinTCrypto/status/1656500956136189952  The TRUTH is that bitcoin CAN scale, and could always scale, both today and 15 years ago. And if scaled correctly and intelligently, it does NOT lead to centralization in any pragmatically meaningful way. Decentralization is a balance of factors and is not an extreme black-or-white calculation, as the Bitcoin Core devs would have you believe. The devs want you to think that if bitcoin scales at all, then its decentralization is over. This is simply not true. There is a harmonious balance that can be struck.  Satoshi himself was in favor of MASSIVE scaling and detailed this in numerous places. A new email recently surfaced from satoshi which makes this more clear than ever. It was uncovered in a court case (see image below). https://x.com/ColinTCrypto/status/1761523084454977615  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  To all those people who keep parroting the nonsense that ""bitcoin can't scale because it would destroy decentralization"", I urge you to consider this:  There are MANY OPTIMIZATIONS (both that we‚Äôve thought of and new ideas that can be developed) that reduce block size and database size.  There are already a number of technologies that exist, such as ‚Äúpruning‚Äù, SPV wallets, compression, and block propagation technologies. There are technologies such as ‚Äúsmall blocks‚Äù, ‚Äúthin blocks‚Äù and ‚Äúxthin blocks‚Äù, which dramatically reduce bandwidth requirements through block propagation compression enhancements. These can reduce bandwidth by 1/10th or more. These are just SOME angles of optimization and are by no means a comprehensive list.  This is in addition to the natural growth of technology of bandwidth, storage technology and computing power. These have increased at a tremendous rate over the past 15 years, and they will continue to do so.  To those who reply in a defeatist manner that ‚ÄúBitcoin CAN'T scale because it ruins decentralization‚Äù:  Really, all such people are confessing to is a lack of creativity, a lack of technical understanding and a lack of willingness to try. They are the same sheep who believe anything the Core devs spoonfed them, in order to stop innovation and new scaling ideas, for ulterior reasons (again, see entire thread here: https://x.com/ColinTCrypto/status/1656500956136189952)  If one simply had the attitude ‚Äúhow could we pull this off?‚Äù, they would then come to realize it IS possible to scale bitcoin on the base layer. Layer 2 scaling is fine too, but not at the detriment of the base layer. Layer 2 scaling also depends in a large part on a scalable layer 1.  So, the next time you hear some flavor of ""bitcoin scaling isn't possible because it harms decentralization"", show them this thread, because what they are saying is a flat out lie.  Satoshi didn‚Äôt have time to explain it to everyone and I see why.",02/25/2024 08:25 PM,True,303,80,64

72,Colin Talks Crypto ü™ô,"BITCOIN DEVELOPERS ARE EITHER INCOMPETENT OR COMPROMISED. WHICH IS IT?   In response to the below post (which went somewhat viral) about Bitcoin‚Äôs failure to scale being due to it being compromised, there were some individuals (mostly diehard maximalists) which made defensive, retaliatory and attacking comments.   Here‚Äôs how I can prove my statement and it‚Äôs up to you to decide whether Bitcoin‚Äôs poor development is due to 1. incompetence or 2. maliciousnes, and that those are the only two real options.  One common rebuttal (which falls flat on its face, as we will see by the end of this post) is ‚Äúsmall blocks keeps bitcoin decentralized‚Äù. This is an ignorant comment as it is black-and-white logic that does not account for nuance.  Since 2009, Bitcoin‚Äôs scaling hasn‚Äôt even kept up with basic technology growth (bandwidth, cpu, ram, storage space). This isn‚Äôt even accounting for improvements that could have been made within the protocol itself‚Äî we‚Äôre just talking pure, raw hardware and bandwidth improvements in computing technology.  CPU, bandwidth, RAM and storage capacity have all increased *massively* over the past 14 years, yet BTC hasn't taken advantage of these technology increases. Segwit was a meager ~2mb increase, again failing to keep up with current technology speeds.  The point? Bitcoin could at least scale up to what modern technology allows WITHOUT SACRIFICING DECENTRALIZATION.  ‚û°Ô∏è The fact that bitcoin doesn‚Äôt make maximum use of modern technology (cpu, bandwidth, storage, ram) is the mind boggling part and the clue to either: bitcoin dev incompetence or being compromised. ‚¨ÖÔ∏è  Instead of asking ‚ÄúWhat is the magic number?‚Äù (for block size), one should be asking ‚Äúhow can bitcoin keep up with technology in a way that allows it to scale along with the growth of Internet bandwidth, CPU power, memory and storage, over time?‚Äù  #Bitcoin SHOULD be taking advantage of the advances in hardware as well as increasing Internet bandwidth. Yet it stays stagnated and does not, at the cost of a poor user experience.  IMO this is very poor developer planning. I attribute it, not to incompetence (because the developers are all highly intelligent), but much more likely to being compromised.  As a side note: personally wonder what bitcoin‚Äôs value would be if it weren't for these artificially imposed bottlenecks, which are WELL BELOW the current technology and bandwidth limits.  imo BTC‚Äôs price would be MUCH higher if it hadn‚Äôt stagnated and chosen to ignore on-chain scaling.  I think we would have already seen a $100k-$200k per bitcoin, or maybe even more, if it were not for this extremely poor development path.  - - -  So let me ask you: are Bitcoin devs incompetent or compromised (a conflict of interest)? Because there‚Äôs really not any other good answer. We‚Äôve proven here that ‚Äúkeeping the network decentralized‚Äù is itself a fallacy of an argument when bitcoin‚Äôs scaling (or lack there of) doesn‚Äôt even keep up with basic technology growth, and instead falls massively behind. We‚Äôre at 2009-2015 technology levels in the year 2023.  Also note: I am not advocating another coin in this message.

29,Nick Neuman,"DON'T LET YOUR BITCOIN DIE WITH YOU üíÄ ‚ö∞Ô∏è  Yea look, nobody likes to admit it but we all have to die one day.   As I've been talking to people about their self custody lately - both Casa members and not - I hear the same thing over and over.  ""What happens if I die?""  Many people feel pretty good about their bitcoin security for themselves. But their family members often have no idea how to use this stuff. Hardware wallet? Seed phrase stamped on metal? Shamir's secret sharing backups using SD cards, a passphrase, and a treasure hunt through the backyard with a shovel? üòµ  We're solving that problem for all Casa members, starting today with Casa Inheritance. A key design principle we kept while building this was to make it as simple as possible for Recipients (your family members that will receive your bitcoin if you pass), while maintaining Casa-level security. An estate transfer is already a stressful time for family, and it can become even more stressful if you add in a crazy treasure hunt to access a fortune in bitcoin.  For our basic 3 key vaults, we wanted it to be as easy as using the app. No metal plates, no need to use a hardware wallet, no magic passwords you have to keep track of or else risk messing up the asset transfer. Simplicity is security.  So how does it work, in detail?  A Vault Owner (Casa member) designates a Recipient (their family or friend) in the Casa app. The Recipient receives an invite to create a free Casa account. The Recipient scans a QR code provided by the Vault Owner, which contains an encrypted version of the owner's mobile key. This encrypted key is only able to be imported by the Recipient's Casa account, and the Recipient can't initially use it or see the vault balance.  If the Vault Owner passes away, the Recipient can request access to the vault in their Casa app. This starts a 6 month timer, and sends a ton of notifications every month to the owner. If the owner is still alive, they can reject the request in app. If they are not, the timer will run out. When it does, the Recipient will be able to use the shared mobile key and the request a signature from the Casa Recovery Key for the shared vault. This gives them 2 out of 3 signatures, enough to access the assets.  For 5 key vault users, one hardware key is shared with the Recipient. This small increase in friction for Recipients is often worth it for the increased security and resilience of a 5 key vault for larger holdings.  To summarize now that you have the details: 1. Share keys and vault access during setup 2. 6 month timelock to ensure no malicious theft 3. Use shared keys and Casa key to access assets  Full setup takes less than 5 minutes.  Inheritance is one of the biggest problems in self custody today. If you've hodled through years of painful bear markets, you owe it to yourself and your family to not let the reward for that patience go to zero because you didn't have a plan - and we're here to make that easy.  Check out the video to see how easy it really is.  Like I said earlier this week - Casa is going after major problems in self-custody this year. Check this one off the list ‚úÖ.

Casey Rodarmor started an art movement on Bitcoin with his original art, the idea and first implementation¬†of Ordinals. ¬† Inscription #0 is his, as well as the launch of the Ordinals website which highlighted the inscription numbers and associated image inscriptions. This led directly to the wave of art as images on Bitcoin with low inscription numbers. The art of being recorded immutably on the timechain¬†and medium of Bitcoin at the earliest time.¬†  Then came art that explored using the medium of Bitcoin in more creative ways. Artists experimented with Recursive Inscriptions, and the art of code. Artists helped evolve Ordinals itself and contributed to the open source code base. Creators created even faster than the protocol allowed or would allow. Creators started their own movements and meta-protocols, like BRC-20, which took the whole Bitcoin blockchain by storm. This would¬†lead to Casey himself to building a competing fungible token protocol called Runes.¬†  Throughout all this, the provenance of art on Bitcoin remained one of the pillars of this art movement. Artists care about the provenance of their works, their collections, and the Parent-Child Provenance feature provided this clear provenance. Not easily visible or browsable in explorers and marketplaces yet, but this feature is standardizing how collections are recorded immutably forever on Bitcoin for future generations to appreciate.  The infrastructure for art on Bitcoin is still being built out, and creating some of the early works required a deep understanding of Bitcoin.

63,Alan Austin,"Seeing a lot of frustration in replies regarding the price of Litecoin. Comments even suggesting there‚Äôs too much focus on ‚Äúsound money‚Äù principles and not enough hype üòë  Has the price of Litecoin been disappointing?  Of course it has. No one feels this as much as those who‚Äôve been working on Litecoin adoption each and every day.  Litecoin is a distributed network that doesn‚Äôt have founder coins to manipulate the price or create artificial supply constraints. Unfortunately for those focused specifically on price, the very same qualities that make Litecoin sound money also impact the way price can behave.  As with most assets, price typically catches up with value at some point, but there‚Äôs no guarantee as to when that happens, and with some assets price always lags behind.  @LTCFoundation has no control over the price of Litecoin, so we focus on what we can help with: Value, by way of Litecoin development and adoption.  And to this point, almost every metric (with the exception of price) continues to show exceptional growth in terms of activity and usage.  In addition to volunteers, Litecoin Foundation has a small paid staff, most of whom who have accepted much less than they can be making elsewhere, because they are passionate about what they do and believe in the importance of sound money and financial privacy in our lives.  So before pointing the finger at Litecoin Foundation or it‚Äôs team because you are frustrated about price, or complaining that the Foundation isn‚Äôt doing enough, remember that this is a decentralized movement and ask yourself what you can be doing to help?     Because if you‚Äôre relying on any single organization or individual for Litecoin‚Äôs success, then you‚Äôre missing the point on what it takes for a decentralized project to become successful.

101,Omid Malekan üßôüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,"Some thoughts on the Binance settlement, with the preamble that I think companies that don‚Äôt like certain laws should still comply with them while campaigning for change.  One interpretation of the government‚Äôs suit and the resulting mammoth settlement is that by refusing to implement compliance schemes like AML & CFT, Binance failed to stop money laundering and the financing of terrorism.  The problem with this interpretation is that vast sums of illicit flows still move through the companies who do comply. Banks, brokers and other types of (mostly non-crypto) intermediaries are the preferred route for tax and sanctions evaders, to the tune of over a trillion dollars a year.  A more accurate interpretation is that Binance refused to participate in the pretense of stopping illicit finance. They didn‚Äôt kick out the occasional bad actor or file endless suspicious activity reports. In other words, they didn‚Äôt play the game, didn‚Äôt pay their annual tithe to the AML-Industrial Complex (a cushy landing spot for ex officials) and didn‚Äôt kiss the ring, as it were.  You could see the Kabuki aspect of all this in the joint press conference held by various Important Government Officials yesterday. If you didn‚Äôt know the context and watched the whole thing on mute you‚Äôd think the Feds just brought down a major drug cartel or rounded up the remnants of ISIS, as opposed to finally extracting their pound of flesh from the preferred trading venue for Dogecoin.   This settlement was so important that it warranted an appearance by the Secretary of the Treasury, but not important enough for her to know how to pronounce the company‚Äôs name.  Also telling: most of the Tough Talk from the People in Suits was about the procedures Binance refused to follow, and notably NOT about the terrorism that Binance enabled.   The same goes for the unsealed settlement docs, full of shocking (not really) revelations like the time some dude in Washington traded $1400 worth of some coin with some dude in Iran. This from the same administration that released $10b to the Iranian government a week ago.  People who sincerely believe that crypto is some unique enabler of bad people doing bad things don‚Äôt understand how the rest of the financial system actually works.   One of the biggest banks in America still operates a division in Russia, and many of the world‚Äôs worst tyrants use America as their piggy bank. But that‚Äôs all considered OK because someobody did the paperwork.  Binance was wrong to lie to its customers and wrong for not being compliant. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a bad company. Spend five minutes googling ‚Äúbanks facilitating money laundering‚Äù and you‚Äôll find that financial firms with household names have been caught doing far worse things involving orders of magnitude more money, yet suffered much milder consequences.  If they‚Äôd been held to the Binance Standard there‚Äôd be hundreds of managing directors in jail and less money for shareholder buybacks (or lobbying). But the bankers were smart enough to never question the game.  Unlike FTX‚Äîa company whose psychopathic leader was beloved by half the people in that press conference not that long ago‚ÄîBinance didn‚Äôt abscond with user money.   It did a reasonably decent job of onboarding tens of millions of poor, brown, and otherwise underprivileged people into the financial system, something the world‚Äôs compliant financial firms have chronically failed to do (which is OK‚Äîit‚Äôs not considered redlining when the AML department holds the pen).  Binance's net contribution to a more inclusive financial system is something to be commended. What remains to be seen is if firms like that can keep serving underserved populations now that they too have agreed to play the game, and do the paperwork.",11/22/2023 04:29 PM,True,1600,433,92
102,CZ üî∂ BNB,"Today, I stepped down as CEO of Binance. Admittedly, it was not easy to let go emotionally. But I know it is the right thing to do. I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself.  Binance is no longer a baby. It is time for me to let it walk and run. I know Binance will continue to grow and excel with the deep bench it has.  I‚Äôm pleased to announce that @_RichardTeng, our now former Global Head of Regional Markets, has been named the new CEO of Binance today.  Richard is a highly qualified leader and, with over three decades of financial services and regulatory experience, he will navigate the company through its next period of growth. He will ensure Binance delivers on our next phase of security, transparency, compliance, and growth.  Prior to joining Binance, Richard was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM); Chief Regulatory Officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX); and Director of Corporate Finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  With Richard and the entire team, I‚Äôm confident that the best days for @Binance and the crypto industry lay ahead.  As a shareholder and former CEO with historical knowledge of our company, I will remain available to the team to consult as needed, consistent with the framework set out in our U.S. agency resolutions.  What‚Äôs next for me?  I will take a break first. I have not had a single day of real (phone off) break for the last 6 and half years.  After that, my current thinking is I will probably do some passive investing, being a minority token/shareholder in startups in areas of blockchain/Web3/DeFi, AI and biotech. I am happy that I will finally have more time to spend looking at DeFi.  I can‚Äôt see myself being a CEO driving a startup again. I am content being an one-shot (lucky) entrepreneur. Should there be listeners, I may be open to being a coach/mentor to a small number of upcoming entrepreneurs, privately. If for nothing else, I can at least tell them what not to do.  On that note, I am proud to point out that in our resolutions with the U.S. agencies they:  - do not allege that Binance misappropriated any user funds, and - do not allege that Binance engaged in any market manipulation.  Funds are SAFU!  With that, I look forward to seeing the new leadership take the reins. Please join me in congratulating Richard on his well-deserved promotion.  Onwards!

THIS IS A WARNING FOR ALL COINBASE USERS!  There has been some sort of a data breach.   First, I received a text message saying that my @coinbase 2FA was changed.  I then received three calls from a @coinbase ""customer support"" that was from a San Fransisco number asking if I was traveling outside of the US and if I requested an email change and a 2FA change. (NOTE: I tried to record this, but couldn't find my wife's phone before they hung up)  I said no to traveling and they said that they cancelled the 2FA and email change request and sent a text to verify it was cancelled.   They then sent me to the 'security' team to verify my account to avoid a 48 hour suspension.   They had my name, my email and my location and sent a 'verification code' email from help@coinbase.com to my personal email.  I told them that I didn't need their assistance and I changed the password already and he told me that it wouldn't work to verify the account and that they would be locking it down for 7 days due to a lack of verification unless I provided the code.  He then got angry and hung up the phone on me after I told him that I wouldn't provide the code.  After the first text, I immediately logged into my #coinbase and changed the password and 2FA and caught on that it was a scam almost immediately, but I doubt that 98-99% of people that get this would realize it and would have unlocked their #coinbase accounts.  For those unaware, the code they sent was my actual 2FA, but they sent it from their own email and were logging into my account to drain it while we were on the phone.

236,Mark Cuban,"The SEC could have easily have gone to them and outlined an exact plan to get them to compliance.  Then if @coinbase or whoever didn't comply, they sue over whatever legal disagreements they have.   Instead they do what they told one of my companies to do when we called, read these cases and get a lawyer to figure it out for you.    That's the fundamental problem of the SEC.  They don't want to help companies get to compliance they want to challenge them to get to compliance    They are full of lawyers.  Lawyers want to litigate.  If you had business people , more like the SBA, there would be more compliance , fewer lawsuits and better investor education and protections .  But if that happened, 2k SEC lawyers would be out of a job.    This isn't new.   It's been the same for decades.  They promote the number of cases and wins the get as their metrics rather than the number of companies they helped get into compliance and the impact those companies had on gdp, jobs and investor returns.    At that point the impact they have on protecting investors would be profound and stand out and most likely they would find the bad actors before they stole money because the connection to investors and real companies would be stronger and they would be willing to communicate about the bad actors.   As it is, no one wants to talk to the SEC because no one trusts them for fear of being in the same situation as @coinbase finds itself    You get what you measure",06/07/2023 04:55 PM,True,3173,604,231
237,"nic ""bankful"" carter","Imagine a Christian getting to heaven's gate and realizing their God wasn't God, but instead Allah, or Krishna, or Zeus, or Thor. And then seeing sinners and heathens ascending the stairs to the holy gates too. That's Bitcoiners realizing that they bet on the wrong horse. That there wasn't anything particular moral or pure or sacred about Bitcoin, and that the world doesn‚Äôt actually care about how immaculate the conception really was.  In the second world, in which Bitcoin continued to thrive, but other coins did so as well, and perhaps surpassed it, the laser eyes would have to admit that they never had any special insight. That the revelations they had so keenly felt were shadows and illusions. That their gurus were false prophets. And this crisis of faith ‚Äì inching closer every day thanks to simple material reality ‚Äì is too painful to bear, so they pray and hope for the collapse of all of the sh*tcoins and the impure Bitcoin competitors and all of the distractions to the ordained mission.  So even though Binance and Coinbase did something immensely good for Bitcoin, and surely added tens or hundreds of billions to its market cap by virtue of the tools they built to support it, they didn‚Äôt do it in a pure way. They sinned by building technology for other coins. By allowing ETH and SOL and XRP to thrive alongside Bitcoin, too. They sinned by not following the holy virtue of Self Custody at all costs (notwithstanding of course that the market didn‚Äôt _want_ self custody). They sinned by not prioritizing the ordained Scaling Solution of Truth in the form of the Lightning Network but instead building other products (that their users wanted) first.  They sinned by (allegedly, in the diseased minds of maxis) creating ‚Äúpaper‚Äù Bitcoin out of thin air, thus wrongfully driving down the price of Bitcoin with dilution that wouldn‚Äôt otherwise exist. (This is a classic goldbug myth that the Bitcoiners inherited for some deranged reason). But most of all they sinned by being polytheists in a monotheist world. And for that, they deserve to be destroyed. Even if Binance operates the biggest p2p onramp to Bitcoin in the global south. (The laser eyes are unconcerned with data or empirical facts.) Even if Coinbase went to bat for Bitcoin versus US regulators for over a decade. Even if the two firms custody more Bitcoin for end users than anyone else. This doesn‚Äôt matter. They‚Äôre impure, and laser eye Bitcoiners aren‚Äôt here for the profit or the adoption. They‚Äôre here to feel morally superior, to dunk on sh*tcoiners, to accelerate towards the rapture in which all fiat dies. They aren‚Äôt trying to reform the existing system or accept half-measures like third party custody, even if highly credible. They aren‚Äôt here for distractions like DeFi or Web3. They‚Äôre here to act out an imagined monetary revolution, mainly on twitter.  This is why the laser eye reaction to the US government attacking stalwart firms like Coinbase or Binance is so revealing. The maxis don‚Äôt care about actual progress or key wins for the industry. They don‚Äôt care about the 100m+ individuals using these firms to hold their coins. They don‚Äôt care about adoption. They don‚Äôt even care about price appreciation (remember, their desire for in-group kinship far exceeds their economic motive). They care about being pure, adhering to the imagined codes of conduct set by their gurus. Even though they ostensibly disdain the usage of state power, they are more than happy to wield it against their enemies if it achieves the goals of the revolution. They care about treasuring the sacred and attacking the profane.  Like all secular cults, the Bitcoin maxi cult is borne out of a loss of meaning in modern society. These people are mostly outcasts who believe that society exists in a fallen state, only to be restored by a monetary revolution. Happy, functional people don‚Äôt spend their days weaving conspiracies about how Jay Powell is specifically conspiring against them. I‚Äôm sympathetic to their search for meaning, but unfortunately as with many secular cults, their programming has gone haywire. Like ducklings believing a human stranger is their mommy, the laser eyes have imprinted upon a technology and wrongly believe it will be their salvation. It‚Äôs nothing of the sort. It‚Äôs a tool, a very good one, but nothing more. It‚Äôs not a culture and it‚Äôs not a way of life.  Unfortunately, the maxi cult isn‚Äôt interested in adoption or the success and proliferation of Bitcoin, but merely its advance in a theologically acceptable manner. But their cult is exclusionary and trades off against the actual usage of Bitcoin as a way to promote financial liberation. For this reason, the maxi cult must be resisted at all costs. Bitcoin‚Äôs fat depends on it.  (2/2)",06/07/2023 04:02 AM,True,1216,156,334
238,"nic ""bankful"" carter","If you're somewhat new to the space and you're wondering why self-professed Bitcoiners today cheered on SEC attacks against the two most important Bitcoin companies of all time, Coinbase and Binance, let me explain...  There's ""people who use Bitcoin"" aka Bitcoiners (the vast majority, ordinary people) and there's people that turned Bitcoin into a secular cult. Call this latter group ""laser eyes"" or ""maxis"", whatever you want, they know who they are, we know who they are. There's no uncertainty about this ‚Äì they are people that elevated Bitcoin from a mere tool to a belief system, a way of life. (They like to quibble over the language but everyone knows who is who here.)  The vast majority of these cult adherents are actually new to Bitcoin. Look at their profiles ‚Äì mostly created 2021 and 2022. They are latecomers, drawn in by the rally in 2021 and the promise of riches and endless price appreciation spun by gurus on Clubhouse during the Covid era. They believed in fallacies like the stock to flow model. They were also attracted to the idea that Bitcoin was not only financially sound, but morally superior too. It was better than the sh*tcoins, better than fiat. By merely tithing your Bitcoin every month, you could bring about a financial transformation to a fairer world, and when fiat and everything else collapsed, you'd be one of the chosen few to be the kings in the new world, a ruler among the ruins.  So why are they giddy about the possible obliteration of Coinbase and Binance, who have collectively onboarded 100m-200m individuals worldwide to crypto and, specifically, Bitcoin? These are de-facto crypto banks for the entire globe, and made owning Bitcoin easy and simple for tens and maybe hundreds of millions. More than anyone, these two firms have made mainstream adoption of Bitcoin possible. Why would the laser eyes cheer government attacks against them?  It's simple. The cultists are intellectually short crypto, more than they are financially long Bitcoin. For the most part, they don't actually have meaningful economic upside in Bitcoin. Since they joined in 2021/22 they mostly lost money in real terms ""stacking sats"". They think that they will eventually be rewarded for their piety, but for now, the amount of real goods they can buy with their sat hoard is actually dwindling. They aren't interested in Bitcoin adoption, or usage of Bitcoin increasing worldwide, because that's not what they're here for. They're here to find social kinship within an in-group of people that lives in a Bitcoiny way. They're here for the party, not for business.  So what attracts these people to Bitcoin? Simply, the secular cult. It's a way of life for people that live on the margins of society ‚Äì people that would otherwise be conspiracists, goldbugs, radical libertarians, etc. Generally, they're unhappy with the status quo and find it convenient to blame central bankers and interest rates, and ultimately ""fiat culture"" for everything wrong with society. Whether this is financial cycles, debt, war, or even more far fetched things like culture, art, food, or fertility. It's all the fault of government spending, inflation, and the debauching effect of fiat money on society. These people believe that they can find a kind of liberation in Bitcoin, especially one that comes at the expense of their fellow man, who they believe is condemned to a kind of financial hellfire that will purge all fiat, Sodom and Gomorrah style. The great flood will come and only Bitcoin will remain. David Gerard once called the laser eye religion an ‚Äúapocalyptic death cult,‚Äù and he‚Äôs mostly right. The entire ideology is premised on the End of fiat, the end of degeneracy, of debt binges, of credit, of largesse, and all of its symptoms in society, and the rebuilding of society around a more honest monetary foundation ‚Äì after a period of complete destruction and anarchy, of course.  (Of course, there's a kernel of truth to everything here, but there's a vast difference between plain observations and the crafting of a literal secular cult around these ideas).  Laser eyes or Bitcoin maximalism isn't ""like a religion,"" it's literally one. It has everything a religion has, and it makes specific claims about genesis, piety, and salvation.  There's a doctrine of absolution/salvation ‚Äì any sin, no matter how heinous is forgiven if you repent, forsake sh*tcoins, and embrace bitcoin. They really mean this too ‚Äì I mean look at some of the most prominent Bitcoin maxi gurus, with grim pasts involved in shilling ICOs to retail. All forgiven post Bitcoin baptism.  There's a conception myth. Bitcoin was created in a uniquely perfect and fair way, nothing else can come close to that, and nothing like that can ever exist again. Only Satoshi's divine Proof of Work and lack of premine can foster a truly global decentralized commodity money.  There's religious texts. Satoshi's original scripture, the white paper, the forum posts, and the subsequent exegesis ‚Äì the Bitcoin Standard and many others.  There‚Äôs specific cultural rituals: eating meat, shooting guns, promoting masculinity, hierarchy, the nuclear family, disdaining progressivism and feminism, and endorsing a kind of ascetism and privation.  There's a tithe ‚Äì stack your sats every two weeks from your paycheck and even if you're losing money (which these class of 2021 Bitcoiners generally have done), you are still doing good, because it's working for the benefit of the church of Bitcoin. (Contrary to what many people think, Bitcoinism isn‚Äôt like the ‚Äòprosperity gospel‚Äô strand of Christianity. In fact, it‚Äôs the opposite. Laser eye Bitcoiners actually celebrate privation, emphasizing the sacrifices they make to grow their Bitcoin stack (think of it as a financial equivalent of religious fasting). This is also why they call themselves ‚Äúplebs‚Äù ‚Äì as a way to claim kinship with the working class ‚Äúlittle guy.‚Äù Again, remember that these are latecomers. They needed to find a moral high ground over the established crypto elites, that mostly made money from their participation in the space, and the pure, underprivileged Bitcoin plebs. If you lack skills or a means to contribute to the industry or to make money from it, the next best thing is to claim a kind of working class, honest virtue, by calling yourself a pleb and thus morally elevating yourself over the impure money grubbing opportunistic elites.)  There's an eschatology ‚Äì the fiat apocalypse / hyperinflation / great debt bubble is coming and no financial asset will be spared, except for the Chosen One (Bitcoin). After the rapture, the Bitcoiners will inherit the earth, and a handful of sats in your wallet today will buy city blocks in the future. You may be a mere pleb today, but you are a baron tomorrow.  There's rituals: making the pilgrimage to El Salvador to make a lightning payment at McDonalds, sweltering in the heat at Bitcoin Miami to see your gurus spout platitudes on stage, paying some twitter influencer $500 for a gristly cut of steak, listening to the same six podcasts host the same dozen guests week in, week out. Trolling the nocoiners and the sh*tcoiners on twitter. Telling your own story of how you ""found bitcoin"" and how it gave you structure and purpose after your divorce. Recruiting new adherents to the cult.  So what does this have to do with Binance and Coinbase? Well even though these firms have done more for Bitcoin adoption and accessibility than literally any other companies in the industry‚Äôs history, they are impure, because they listed other coins. They built what people wanted, and that was tools and applications beyond just Bitcoin. The laser eyes harp about Brian Armstrong's early tweets about being focused on Bitcoin, before he learned from the market that to survive, he had to build what people actually wanted, not what a small minority of zealots insisted on. (This is why you wont find any maxis building real companies, because to be a founder is to be forced to accept market realities, rather than trying to impose your ideology forcibly on the world.)  Binance and Coinbase may have made questionable listing and product decisions (and to be clear, they're very different companies, with different regulatory strategies and risk appetites, so I don't mean to imply they are similar in that respect), but they did provide the tools for Bitcoin to achieve global adoption in a way that wasn't possible before.  But these laser eyes see the world through the lens of the sacred and the profane. They aren't focused on Bitcoin's success. They would rather live in a world of purity in which Bitcoin is marginal and niche (but all competing coins had failed), than a fallen world in which Bitcoin is much bigger, but other blockchains survived and thrived. To live in this second would would be to admit that Bitcoin wasn't Special and Uniquely Good and Moral, but it was simply a tool, one tool among others, some of which proved more successful and adaptive. If this second world came to pass, Bitcoiners would have to accept that their God was a false one, that their faith was misplaced, that their ordained future didn't and would never occur. Even if the fiat apocalypse did come, and Bitcoiners weren't uniquely saved, but others were too.  (1/2)",06/07/2023 04:01 AM,True,3903,784,979

Between 2008-22, the Fed partnered with a handful of big banks to print $10 trillion-ten centuries of wealth in 15 years ‚Äî a bonanza for the Banksters.   Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin give the public an escape route from the splatter zone when this bubble invariably bursts. So the White House is colluding with the banksters to keep us all trapped in the bubble of profiteering and control.  In his Feb. 8 post on Pirate Wires, Nic Carter @nic__carter describes how the White House has organized bankers to participate in a sophisticated, widespread crackdown to destroy the crypto industry. Carter describes 15 incidents where President Biden has weaponized FDIC, OCC + DOJ to force crypto-friendly banks to close their doors to crypto firms since Dec. 3. The recent crackdown on crypto blocks exit ramps, removes alternative rails, and strengthens government control over both the financial and political systems.  We should be wary since CBDCs are the ultimate mechanisms for social surveillance and control. As Balaji Srinivasan @balajis says, ‚ÄúThe distinction between FedNow and a CBDC is important from a technical standpoint, but not from a civil liberties standpoint.‚Äù Balaji compares FedNow to ‚Äúa virus that has evolved to evade recognition by changing its sequence without really changing its function.""",04/10/2023 06:51 PM,True,24288,7553,1270

441,Bitwise,"Bitwise is publishing a new correlation analysis today as part of its new spot Ethereum ETF filing.  This is the first ETH correlation analysis to replicate the specific methodology used by the SEC in their evaluation of bitcoin, and the results are encouraging.  The correlation values for the full sample period only differ up to 0.2% for the hourly correlation, 5% for the five-minute correlation, and 8% for the one-minute correlation.  To replicate the specific methodology used by the SEC in their evaluation of bitcoin, Bitwise‚Äôs study used:  - Same length of sample period: ~2.5 years - Same intraday correlation intervals: 1 hr, 5 min, and 1 min - Same markets: Coinbase/Kraken vs. CME - Same correlation statistic: Pearson correlation over log returns - Same three-month rolling window min/max analysis  We believe the results show strong correlation between the ETH spot market and CME ETH futures market, at a level substantially similar to the findings of the SEC‚Äôs analysis in the spot bitcoin ETF approval order.  The analysis is included in the new 19b-4 filed by NYSE Arca today seeking approval to list Bitwise‚Äôs spot Ethereum ETF, where you can see this analysis in full: https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/markets/nyse-arca/rule-filings/filings/2024/SR-NYSEArca-2024-31.pdf",03/28/2024 07:11 PM,True,937,204,74

This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself.  Binance is no longer a baby. It is time for me to let it walk and run. I know Binance will continue to grow and excel with the deep bench it has.  I‚Äôm pleased to announce that @_RichardTeng, our now former Global Head of Regional Markets, has been named the new CEO of Binance today.  Richard is a highly qualified leader and, with over three decades of financial services and regulatory experience, he will navigate the company through its next period of growth. He will ensure Binance delivers on our next phase of security, transparency, compliance, and growth.  Prior to joining Binance, Richard was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM); Chief Regulatory Officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX); and Director of Corporate Finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  With Richard and the entire team, I‚Äôm confident that the best days for @Binance and the crypto industry lay ahead.  As a shareholder and former CEO with historical knowledge of our company, I will remain available to the team to consult as needed, consistent with the framework set out in our U.S. agency resolutions.  What‚Äôs next for me?  I will take a break first. I have not had a single day of real (phone off) break for the last 6 and half years.  After that, my current thinking is I will probably do some passive investing, being a minority token/shareholder in startups in areas of blockchain/Web3/DeFi, AI and biotech. I am happy that I will finally have more time to spend looking at DeFi.  I can‚Äôt see myself being a CEO driving a startup again. I am content being an one-shot (lucky) entrepreneur. Should there be listeners, I may be open to being a coach/mentor to a small number of upcoming entrepreneurs, privately. If for nothing else, I can at least tell them what not to do.  On that note, I am proud to point out that in our resolutions with the U.S. agencies they:  - do not allege that Binance misappropriated any user funds, and - do not allege that Binance engaged in any market manipulation.  Funds are SAFU!  With that, I look forward to seeing the new leadership take the reins. Please join me in congratulating Richard on his well-deserved promotion.  Onwards!

226,CZ üî∂ BNB,"Guess what? You can be criticized when you donate $3 million dollars worth of crypto after an earthquake.  While we got overwhelming positive feedback from our users about the donation (as seen in the quoted tweet), and while the issues raised are typically from traditional charity organizations who are not familiar with crypto, we still take the feedback seriously.  Here are 5 common issues raised:  1. People need food and water, not crypto.   We agree with that. Binance has dual programs. Binance has a history of providing essential items. Eg, food, water, masks, and even oxygen tanks that can save 12,000 people for covid victims in India, etc. These take time to organize. Crypto is fast.  2. People need cash, not crypto.   Crypto can be converted to cash readily, especially for our users.   A non crypto person saying crypto is not cash is like a blind person saying lights are useless.  3. The donation only helps our users, not all people in need.  We agree with that. We can only reach our users at this speed. We are not saying we can solve all problems, but we try to help the little bit where we can. That‚Äôs what donations are.  4. Some of our users receiving the donation are not in affected areas.  We use a tiered system where our users closer to the epicenter get more. The POA (proof of address) system is not perfect, but it's what we got.  We believe the earthquake has long term economic impact for the country as a whole. Helping our users can't hurt.  5. Why don‚Äôt we donate through traditional charity organizations?   Actually, we do. Charity donations do not have to be mutually exclusive. Binance works with many leading charity organizations in the world.  Traditional charities have some issues too though. The lack of traceability makes it difficult for our internal impact analysis.  With crypto, I can tell you we helped about 70,000 people in Morocco, and another 12,000 people in Libya.  We believe in direct giving.

There have been a lot of negative news/rumors, bank runs, lawsuits, closing of fiat channels, product wind downs, employee turnover, exit markets, etc.  Guess what we don't have?  No liquidity issues. All withdrawals (and deposits) are properly handled. All customer funds are #SAFU, and 100% reserved.  There are also: won court cases, bank run handled and then record deposits, new fiat channels, smooth sunsetting of old products and launching of new products, new hires, new markets.

268,Hypnogaba,"My experience with @binance .  Now, as always in recent years, the world's largest crypto exchange is getting a lot of fud. Not only regulators are trying to limit the possibilities for DEXes (and users in the end), but also entire countries in one form or another are trying to ""protect"" their citizens more and more by limiting access to different financial instruments.   I am not against restrictions and regulations. I know that Binance was one of the co-authors of the innovative legislation for France and the whole of Europe, MICA, which was supposed to develop the rules of the game and make life easier for ordinary users and protect their rights.   But today is not about that.  My experience has shown that @binance  has become a salvation for me over the past 3 years. Because of the war, all external payments from my country were blocked. And since I had some savings in the bank, if it wasn't for Binance and their p2p service, I would not have been able to get my money. Also, with the help of the Binance card, I am able to receive my salary and pay for my daily needs. All over the world. Easily and securely. Due to certain circumstances, I also switched to Binance earn as the most stable and profitable way to store my funds and receive passive income.   What's my point? I'm just a simple person, but life would be much more difficult for me without the features offered by Binance.   Looking to the future, I realize that cryptocurrencies and the modern digital services of WEB3 will not disappear.  That's why I registered a sub-account and save money for my daughter's education there) Because I know that in 18 years they will be there+ with a good % on top.   My post is a regular user's post, a post of a person who is grateful for everything that @cz_binance  and @davidprincay create.  I feel that this multi-million dollar corporation is doing its best  for all its users and I appreciate it.  THANK YOU.",09/06/2023 07:22 AM,True,781,156,237
