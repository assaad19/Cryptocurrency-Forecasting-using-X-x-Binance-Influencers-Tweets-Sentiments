336,1512,Altcoin Sherpa,"why do people like trading vs. just buy and hold?  a few reasons imo:  it feels like you're actively making money and can 'pay yourself'.   ie. you buy $btc at 40k and you sell it at 42k. you have your principle $ and can cash out the profits to your bank account. you can take that $ and go to the next trade and also make $ actively  it feels much different than if you just buy btc and hold it for 6 months. because the trading aspect involves more skill and you can actually reap more rewards (when done correctly).   with that said, it's oftentimes hard to trade in certain conditions and most people fuck it up. and in super strong bull markets, the majority of participants would probably be better off holding than actively trading.  still, if you're full time crypto, you've got bills to pay. i get it. you need to make some $ and it feels lame to just buy some random small cap and wait for it to 100x. so you will continue to draw support/resistance lines on the chart and continue to learn.   the general path that i've seen most crypto participants go towards is:  poor/grinding-> trading a ton, learning the ropes, trying to get any $ you can get, flip around, rotate, etc  mid rich-> swing trading more, able to hold ideas longer, still have entry/exits, less rotation  whale-> less risk overall, happy to just have longer holding periods, maybe shift more to venture, more buy and hold and just go into a coma (aka degenspartan).   because the richer you are, the more you are in protection mode vs. pure growth.  i'm not saying you can't be profitable trading. it's much easier in the bull market when easy mode is on and you can simply buy every dip. but with that said, i think that the best path for most people is to just do research, buy some coins in a sector you like (ie. ai), and just hold and do your regular day to day.  but if you're actively in the trenches and actively trading every day because you are a degenerate and fighting with everyone else in the orderbooks...  as a fellow retail trader...  i salute you.",2024-02-22 21:33:00,True,313,44,58,2024,BTC,neutral,0.3506723,0.148518,0.5008097

530,2605,Cred,"a few common mistakes in these conditions:  1. excessive leverage. specifically, introducing liquidation risk in assets that are regularly moving 10%-20%+ in a day. let the volatility do the heavy lifting, not the leverage (or specifically, massively inflated position sizes facilitated by leverage that force you to use very tight stops or liquidate you on small moves against you).  2. excessively tight stops. same consideration. if you're targeting larger rotations in a higher volatility asset, being overly tight with stop placement can work against you. you don't want to create a loop where your idea is broadly correct, you get wicked out because you were larping as some 50r tick sniper, and then the market moves straight to your target without you.  3. excessive rotation. if you're trying to make the most of a multi-week and multi-month trending period, you shouldn't be overly concerned with any specific 24h window of returns. it is a form of overtrading. it is also a form of fomo. this also introduces the risk of creating a loop whereby you sell your bags to chase the strong stuff --> strong stuff consolidates --> the bags you sold moon --> repeat ad infinitum. find some setups or ideas that you like and give them some room to breathe.  4. mistaking consolidation for weakness. this is another version of time-based fomo. participants will infer that just because their bags haven't turbo mooned in a short period of time, the market is weak or they've allocated poorly. instead, your rebuttable presumption should be that consolidations are a form of pullback and present an opportunity to buy stuff that eluded you when it was breaking out. boredom and impatience do not necessarily signal weakness.  5. excessive trade management. the degree to which you intervene in your trade ideas should somewhat mirror the time frames of those ideas. for example, if your trade is predicated on a breakout from a multi-week range, your targets and trade management time frames should be derived from (or resemble) the weekly time frame. that makes more sense than, for example, buying a large weekly breakout and setting a target at 15m resistance that's 5% higher and panicking over every red 5m candle.  6. overtrading your core holdings. there are countless stories of traders getting very good swing and/or htf positional entries but gradually fumbling them through trying to time every single dip and rotation that takes place on the way to their target. an unfortunately common version of this is selling 100% of exposure at some level in order to 'buy back lower'. this is particularly a strange choice when a trader's target is materially higher than the pullback they're hoping to rebuy. for example, if your ultimate target is 50% higher, is it worth selling all of your exposure in an attempt to time a 5%-10% dip? this can result in the market not offering the pullback that was hoped for, and now the trader is sidelined - this usually comes with a mental block, as buying back higher than you sold can be psychologically tricky/feels like you're chasing. in short, this is a form of overoptimisation. if you're bored and feel like gambling in between, use a sub account or @breakoutprop (disclaimer: i have a financial interest in its success) so you can scratch the trading itch without sabotaging yourself. or go to the casino, get a hobby, whatever.  7. excessive number of open positions. with every added position, your capacity to effectively manage any single position decreases. the altcoin market is still pretty tightly positively correlated, so you're more likely just spreading yourself thin rather than 'diversifying'. focusing on a smaller number of higher conviction trade ideas and managing them patiently and judiciously is probably better than trying to catch everything at once and drowning in noise. if you want to spread yourself thin, go buy some solana shitter lottery tickets i.e. x amount of $ across [large number] of memecoins/new coins that will either go to 0 or appear on your feed when you're up multiples. at least that doesn't take up your trade management ram.  8. allowing social media to materially impact your perception. it's pnl + leaderboard season. it may feel like absolutely everyone is winning massively all the time. granted, the market has been very good unless you've been stubbornly short, but social media is still a highlight reel boosted by selection bias and survivorship bias. you don't see the fumbled entries, the break evens, the times traders got stopped at the bottom, undersizing great ideas and oversizing bad ideas, not pulling the trigger, and so on. as long as you're trading well and improving, don't try to speed run some arbitrary returns or net worth goal.  tl;dr i ain't reading all that. i'm happy for u tho. or sorry that happened. stop writing essays nerd give me a ticker",2024-03-13 11:28:00,True,3372,590,245,2024,BTC,neutral,0.08068623,0.42950043,0.48981336

977,5830,Colin Talks Crypto 🪙,"one of the biggest lies that was pushed upon the bitcoin community was that “bitcoin can’t scale without sacrificing decentralization”.  i see people regurgitating this left and right. this was apparently a highly effective lie.  this lie was pushed by corrupted developers who were paid by big banks to stifle bitcoin. i know it sounds crazy, but it's true. you can see who paid their salaries here (read the entire thread and all supporting links/videos): https://x.com/colintcrypto/status/1656500956136189952  this lie was spread intentionally through the use of mass censorship and social media engineering many years ago (much in the same manner that we see heavily employed today on topics such as world politics and health). you can read about this corruption of bitcoin development in the following thread (make sure to scroll down to read the full thread and read/watch all supporting links) here: https://x.com/colintcrypto/status/1656500956136189952  the truth is that bitcoin can scale, and could always scale, both today and 15 years ago. and if scaled correctly and intelligently, it does not lead to centralization in any pragmatically meaningful way. decentralization is a balance of factors and is not an extreme black-or-white calculation, as the bitcoin core devs would have you believe. the devs want you to think that if bitcoin scales at all, then its decentralization is over. this is simply not true. there is a harmonious balance that can be struck.  satoshi himself was in favor of massive scaling and detailed this in numerous places. a new email recently surfaced from satoshi which makes this more clear than ever. it was uncovered in a court case (see image below). https://x.com/colintcrypto/status/1761523084454977615  ————  to all those people who keep parroting the nonsense that ""bitcoin can't scale because it would destroy decentralization"", i urge you to consider this:  there are many optimizations (both that we’ve thought of and new ideas that can be developed) that reduce block size and database size.  there are already a number of technologies that exist, such as “pruning”, spv wallets, compression, and block propagation technologies. there are technologies such as “small blocks”, “thin blocks” and “xthin blocks”, which dramatically reduce bandwidth requirements through block propagation compression enhancements. these can reduce bandwidth by 1/10th or more. these are just some angles of optimization and are by no means a comprehensive list.  this is in addition to the natural growth of technology of bandwidth, storage technology and computing power. these have increased at a tremendous rate over the past 15 years, and they will continue to do so.  to those who reply in a defeatist manner that “bitcoin can't scale because it ruins decentralization”:  really, all such people are confessing to is a lack of creativity, a lack of technical understanding and a lack of willingness to try. they are the same sheep who believe anything the core devs spoonfed them, in order to stop innovation and new scaling ideas, for ulterior reasons (again, see entire thread here: https://x.com/colintcrypto/status/1656500956136189952)  if one simply had the attitude “how could we pull this off?”, they would then come to realize it is possible to scale bitcoin on the base layer. layer 2 scaling is fine too, but not at the detriment of the base layer. layer 2 scaling also depends in a large part on a scalable layer 1.  so, the next time you hear some flavor of ""bitcoin scaling isn't possible because it harms decentralization"", show them this thread, because what they are saying is a flat out lie.  satoshi didn’t have time to explain it to everyone and i see why.",2024-02-25 20:25:00,True,303,80,64,2024,BTC,negative,0.0686657,0.49740943,0.43392485

999,6124,Alan Austin,"seeing a lot of frustration in replies regarding the price of litecoin. comments even suggesting there’s too much focus on “sound money” principles and not enough hype 😑  has the price of litecoin been disappointing?  of course it has. no one feels this as much as those who’ve been working on litecoin adoption each and every day.  litecoin is a distributed network that doesn’t have founder coins to manipulate the price or create artificial supply constraints. unfortunately for those focused specifically on price, the very same qualities that make litecoin sound money also impact the way price can behave.  as with most assets, price typically catches up with value at some point, but there’s no guarantee as to when that happens, and with some assets price always lags behind.  @ltcfoundation has no control over the price of litecoin, so we focus on what we can help with: value, by way of litecoin development and adoption.  and to this point, almost every metric (with the exception of price) continues to show exceptional growth in terms of activity and usage.  in addition to volunteers, litecoin foundation has a small paid staff, most of whom who have accepted much less than they can be making elsewhere, because they are passionate about what they do and believe in the importance of sound money and financial privacy in our lives.  so before pointing the finger at litecoin foundation or it’s team because you are frustrated about price, or complaining that the foundation isn’t doing enough, remember that this is a decentralized movement and ask yourself what you can be doing to help?     because if you’re relying on any single organization or individual for litecoin’s success, then you’re missing the point on what it takes for a decentralized project to become successful.  we can do this together.",2024-02-20 21:39:00,True,185,44,51,2024,ETH,neutral,0.14054102,0.34377873,0.5156803

if you are looking to make life-changing gains from #crypto, you still have a lot of opportunities.
 
remember, in crypto, there are no such things as too low or too high.
 
back in 2021, when #sol was trading at $2.

people said that it had a maximum 10x potential given the market size.
 
the same happened with #matic, ftm, shib, #doge, axs, and many other tokens.
 
people called their top at 10x, then 20x, and even 50x.
 
in the end, they all pulled a 𝟭𝟬𝟬𝘅-𝟭𝟱𝟬𝘅 in just 1 year.
 
right now, a lot of people are waiting for new lows in their favourite alts, and in most cases, it will probably not happen.
 
so, the best thing is to dca in when there is a dip and dca out when there are big pumps.
 
if you play the next 2 years with a good strategy, you will be rich.
 
i'll also find gem coins for you and put them on your radar, but in the end, it all depends on your strategy.

the protocol tech stack, including winr account abstraction, winr vrf, and winr games, will be deployed on fantom and utilized by https://t.co/qukvbumuyk. https://t.co/qukvbumuyk will be the first-ever white-label user of the protocol on fantom.

https://t.co/qukvbumuyk is operated by a completely separate team, and they will receive all of the upcoming games launching on the protocol, including unity-based table games and +10 unity-based grid slot games based on massively popular slots around web2 that generate the most revenue and acquire the highest amount of users, starting next month.

https://t.co/qukvbumuyk will operate a private version of the winr liquidity pool engine, and while all of the smart contracts will be verified and transparent, they will be running a private bankroll.

the new budget system that winr labs has been working on has been battle-tested on https://t.co/urs0kbo2ur, will work as the accounting model for the bankroll, determining the revenue on each epoch to distribute a part of the revenue of https://t.co/qukvbumuyk to winr stakeholders. after each weekly epoch, 20% of all the profits generated by the platform will be distributed on arbitrum, adding to the daily revenue being shared.

the budget model has also been implemented to permissionless frontend operators framework and solana codebase, which is on ongoing audit with ottersec (@osec_io). more details on this will become available on this friday's monthly dev update, including deployment of winr vrf on @xai_games with more partnerships coming with the gaming projects that will utilize the fastest random number generation on any evm.",2024-02-19 11:42:00,False,316,78,47,2024,SOL,neutral,0.19852336,0.011036186,0.7904405

1250,7549,WR☻NGUSER ✗,"you're getting used to it so here are a few thoughts/updates on a handful of bags i shared before and still hold:

- madlads:
not a secret for anyone anymore, madlads are the face of solana, they are getting every significant airdrop and the collection is currently sitting at a mere $22k floor, i added a ""wormhole"" tagged lad just a couple days for 230 sol expecting a nice stimmy on it as well, currently holding 3

- node monkes: 
back to $10k a pop, long term chart clearly looks like some accumulation happening monkes are going to stronger hands lately, highest unique ownership % and lowest listing % ever
ogs stepping out and bidding one of the only collections worth bidding on the mother chain, frog still holds all 7 and has no plans on selling them at all

- puppets: 
up in btc, up more than 2x in usd since i shared about them, not much to say other than i'm holding them for higher since it's one of the most established community in ordinals, holding 9

- $chex: 
holding strong, price action looks like there's no a single soul out there willing to sell its bag at current prices, we still have a ton of room to go and i'm not trying to fumble my bag by swinging it, there's only one $chex and the competition is still a thousand miles away

- $tybg:
doesn't get much easier than $tybg when it comes to an insane asymetry that the market doesn't want to price correctly, i suggest reading this tweet to understand what's up with it: https://t.co/gtstctjnke
i was looking for base exposure, i think i got my winner, holding strong as well

also exploring @ethena_labs which raised a bunch of money from serious vcs and prominent people, it's a yield bearing synthetic stablecoin from what i understood and the yield is backed by actual eth yield + funding yield
going to lp some money as soon as i figured how hard i wanna go there, epoch 1 ends in 14 days and the cheapest points are going out as we speak, if you're planning to farm you better start asap before it goes to a billy in tvl and it stops making sense farming, join here: https://t.co/nzgy9ezpdb

1261,7562,SIR DRΞY OF THE VILLΞ ⨀ (Learning Arc),"today, we'll explore solana's premier liquidity protocol, and understand its inner workings.

@meteoraag is a key player in solana's liquidity landscape, focused on creating a secure, sustainable yield layer for solana defi. their dlmm protocol empowers solana protocols to manage liquidity dynamically.

dlmm addresses key issues of traditional liquidity pools like capital inefficiency, impermanent loss, limited flexibility, and high slippage. it allows liquidity concentration within specific price ranges, optimizing capital utilization and reducing impermanent loss risks.

dlmm operates by organizing liquidity into discrete price bins, offering precise liquidity concentration without slippage. users can choose from three main strategies: spot, curve, and bid-ask, each catering to different market conditions and lp preferences.

the key features of dlmm include precise liquidity concentration, flexibility in volatility strategy selection, and dynamic fees to capitalize on market volatility. however, users must be aware of impermanent loss, complexity, price range selection, market volatility, and protocol risks associated with dlmm.

in conclusion, while dlmm introduces complexities and risks, it also offers innovative solutions to enhance liquidity provision on solana. meteora's commitment to improving efficiency and profitability through dlmm is commendable, making it a promising tool for solana defi growth.

if you'd like to know more about meteora's dlmm, then you should check out this indepth and more detailed medium article i penned down: https://t.co/ucneywpecj

the protocol tech stack, including winr account abstraction, winr vrf, and winr games, will be deployed on fantom and utilized by https://t.co/qukvbumuyk. https://t.co/qukvbumuyk will be the first-ever white-label user of the protocol on fantom.

https://t.co/qukvbumuyk is operated by a completely separate team, and they will receive all of the upcoming games launching on the protocol, including unity-based table games and +10 unity-based grid slot games based on massively popular slots around web2 that generate the most revenue and acquire the highest amount of users, starting next month.

https://t.co/qukvbumuyk will operate a private version of the winr liquidity pool engine, and while all of the smart contracts will be verified and transparent, they will be running a private bankroll.

the new budget system that winr labs has been working on has been battle-tested on https://t.co/urs0kbo2ur, will work as the accounting model for the bankroll, determining the revenue on each epoch to distribute a part of the revenue of https://t.co/qukvbumuyk to winr stakeholders. after each weekly epoch, 20% of all the profits generated by the platform will be distributed on arbitrum, adding to the daily revenue being shared.

the budget model has also been implemented to permissionless frontend operators framework and solana codebase, which is on ongoing audit with ottersec (@osec_io). more details on this will become available on this friday's monthly dev update, including deployment of winr vrf on @xai_games with more partnerships coming with the gaming projects that will utilize the fastest random number generation on any evm.",2024-02-19 11:42:00,False,316,78,47,2024,SOL,neutral,0.19852336,0.011036186,0.7904405

1367,7684,WR☻NGUSER ✗,"you're getting used to it so here are a few thoughts/updates on a handful of bags i shared before and still hold:

- madlads:
not a secret for anyone anymore, madlads are the face of solana, they are getting every significant airdrop and the collection is currently sitting at a mere $22k floor, i added a ""wormhole"" tagged lad just a couple days for 230 sol expecting a nice stimmy on it as well, currently holding 3

- node monkes: 
back to $10k a pop, long term chart clearly looks like some accumulation happening monkes are going to stronger hands lately, highest unique ownership % and lowest listing % ever
ogs stepping out and bidding one of the only collections worth bidding on the mother chain, frog still holds all 7 and has no plans on selling them at all

- puppets: 
up in btc, up more than 2x in usd since i shared about them, not much to say other than i'm holding them for higher since it's one of the most established community in ordinals, holding 9

- $chex: 
holding strong, price action looks like there's no a single soul out there willing to sell its bag at current prices, we still have a ton of room to go and i'm not trying to fumble my bag by swinging it, there's only one $chex and the competition is still a thousand miles away

- $tybg:
doesn't get much easier than $tybg when it comes to an insane asymetry that the market doesn't want to price correctly, i suggest reading this tweet to understand what's up with it: https://t.co/gtstctjnke
i was looking for base exposure, i think i got my winner, holding strong as well

also exploring @ethena_labs which raised a bunch of money from serious vcs and prominent people, it's a yield bearing synthetic stablecoin from what i understood and the yield is backed by actual eth yield + funding yield
going to lp some money as soon as i figured how hard i wanna go there, epoch 1 ends in 14 days and the cheapest points are going out as we speak, if you're planning to farm you better start asap before it goes to a billy in tvl and it stops making sense farming, join here: https://t.co/nzgy9ezpdb

1378,7697,SIR DRΞY OF THE VILLΞ ⨀ (Learning Arc),"today, we'll explore solana's premier liquidity protocol, and understand its inner workings.

@meteoraag is a key player in solana's liquidity landscape, focused on creating a secure, sustainable yield layer for solana defi. their dlmm protocol empowers solana protocols to manage liquidity dynamically.

dlmm addresses key issues of traditional liquidity pools like capital inefficiency, impermanent loss, limited flexibility, and high slippage. it allows liquidity concentration within specific price ranges, optimizing capital utilization and reducing impermanent loss risks.

dlmm operates by organizing liquidity into discrete price bins, offering precise liquidity concentration without slippage. users can choose from three main strategies: spot, curve, and bid-ask, each catering to different market conditions and lp preferences.

the key features of dlmm include precise liquidity concentration, flexibility in volatility strategy selection, and dynamic fees to capitalize on market volatility. however, users must be aware of impermanent loss, complexity, price range selection, market volatility, and protocol risks associated with dlmm.

in conclusion, while dlmm introduces complexities and risks, it also offers innovative solutions to enhance liquidity provision on solana. meteora's commitment to improving efficiency and profitability through dlmm is commendable, making it a promising tool for solana defi growth.

1663,8003,Ignas | DeFi Research,"restaking is expanding beyond ethereum.

the top 4 current frontrunners 👇

• @babylon_chain's bitcoin staking protocol.

babylon allows #btc to be used for staking in proof-of-stake blockchains, increasing their security without the need of inflationary native token rewards while giving yield on native #btc.

thanks to restaking, btc won't be just hard money, but will become a productive asset.

• @linearprotocol: stake $near, get $linear lst token.

linear will launch $blinear (boosted linear) liquid restaked token (lrt) and holders of $lnr token will decide which services will be validated.

$lnr airdr0p coming soon with a lock-drop campaign.

two other protocols i've shared before, but here's a recap:

• @oct_network $oct: restaking on near.

appchains in the octopus network scale their security using lpos (leased proof-of-stake) and @ottochain_ is the first appchain launched.

unlike linear, restaking near to octopus won't give you a liquid restaked token, so your staked near can't be further used in defi.

• @picasso_network $pica is bringing restaking for solana, polkadot, ethereum and other chains.

picasso just launched lst for $dot, $lsdot which will be used for restaking to secure @composablefin network (first bridging and later other middleware infra and dapps).

restaking for solana will support sol, msol, jitosol, and lp tokens.

nebraska has now officially introduced a bill championing the rights of bitcoin users. this bill is very similar to the bill that was announced earlier this week from missouri.

i will tell you more about the bill and how you can help us pass it in your state below.

once passed into law, this bill will defend your fundamental #bitcoin rights, including...

- securing your right to self-custody #bitcoin
- defending your 'right to mine' bitcoin
- ending discrimination against #bitcoin miners
- guarantees your sovereign ability to run a node.
- protecting your ability to purchase, save, and transact with bitcoin.
- eliminating state capital gains taxes on #bitcoin transactions under $200.
- stops bad regulations from damaging future bitcoin innovation

this bill, sponsored by senator bostar (@bostareliot), adds nebraska to the forefront of states advocating for your right to self-custody, purchase, use, spend #bitcoin, and crucially, to mine and run a bitcoin node! you can read more about the bill below.

this nebraska bill builds on the foundational work of congressman mike flood (@usrepmikeflood) before he graduated to washington, dc. we are thankful for his leadership in this arena.

we need your voice: volunteer for #bitcoin advocacy

we plan to introduce 13 bills in 13 different states (at least) in 2024. each time a bill is introduced, lawmakers in the state often hold a hearing to receive input from the public.

and this is where your assistance will be invaluable.

you can volunteer to provide written or verbal testimony in support of these pro-#bitcoin bills!

by volunteering to provide written or verbal testimony, you play a direct role in the passage of these transformative laws. we need individuals like you to step up and support these bills. please sign up now to be added to our short list of volunteers!

sign-up to volunteer today: https://t.co/3siwmselvv

by signing up to volunteer with us, you're not just defending your rights as a bitcoin user; you're also contributing to a historical movement.

sign up to make history with us!

don't miss this opportunity to be part of a pivotal moment in bitcoin's journey. together we can pass pro-#bitcoin bills across the usa.

those laws will protect your right to self-custody, mine, and run a node. they will also eliminate state level capital gains on your #bitcoin transactions under $200!

sessions are ramping up as we speak, so please do not wait to throw your name in the hat. once you have signed up share this link with others you know who can help us: https://t.co/3siwmselvv

join us & make a difference

as we embark on this journey to secure your #bitcoin rights, your support and involvement are invaluable. with each state that passes these laws, we come closer to realizing a future where bitcoin is not just accepted, but protected and embraced.

thank you for your dedication to this cause. your participation makes all the difference.

you see, the way this world traditionally was like this:

1) a company is formed and operates successfully for a number of years;
2) company raises money in ""private"" rounds from venture capital firms and other inside wall street institutions;
3) after $100s of millions and in some cases billions have already been made, then the same wall street insiders move to offer shared in the company to the general public, you and me, via an ipo (initial public offering). we were always last. 

#bitcoin has totally and fairly reversed this:
1) #btc is launched in january 3, 2009 for the entire world at a price of $0, where it stays for nearly one full year with no insiders;
2) #btc never raises money from anyone or anything, ensuring no leaders or insiders;
3) wall street is only now able to get involved and buy, as of today, 15 years later, via a vehicle called a spot etf. for the first time, they are the last. this is why i call today the institutional ipo. 

for the first time in history, the public, the every day individual had the opportunity to front run the banks, the venture capital firms, the wall streeters, the financial institutions of the world and #bitcoin delivered that to us.

“𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐁𝐢𝐭𝐟𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫” my first onchain art inscription got a bid from legendary @way2collector 🫂 after a few hours auction started for 72 hours! ⏰ 

current bid: 0.005 #btc 

story & auction link 🔻

first of all, i wanna thanks to @bitgod21 the legend who introduced me into the ordinals. he’s great person for real, did a lot for me on this journey 🫂 has a place in my heart and my respect for sure cose as a believer of ordinals, this means a lot to me! 🫡🧡

after then we talked with @meonbtc around the beginning of october 2023 for the @magiceden launchpad and gave my interview about myself and for my art. they’re really supportive and great guys 🫂  i wanna thanks to the team @mikey_big69, @exanft, @codyonchainft, @sirgnarlgnomie and habby for their guidance and helps 🙏🏻 🧡

yes, gas was high lol and we were keeping eyes on mempool to catch a reasonable sats for inscription and still costed a lot quite compared with eth but for me it was really important and very exciting cose having my art onchain, ordinals community i was really passionate about it. not gonna be my last piece on bitcoin, but firsts are always special and the piece shows itself at this point 🧡

i was thinking to start the auction for “the bitfather” exactly the time bitcoin etf approved. this is my crypto art, regarding to the community, to the meme lovers, to the satoshi nakamoto, the legend, my genesis art onchain ordinal, same day, mass adoption. this had to be historic at least for me.

and yes, yesterday sec x account posted about etf confirmation then we immediately started the auction, but after a few mins gensler tweeted that sec x account was compromised lol the moment was so shocking and fun tbh that i will never forget hahah 

then i woke up with @way2collector dms and another emotional moment happened. it’s his first bid on ordinals! 🧡 this, made this piece and journey way more memorable for me. since i know him, he’s really kind person and always teaches you what he knows 🙌 he has my respect 🫡 glad my piece resonated with you and your journey also started with my art 🫂

let’s see, i hope etf gets approved and mass adoption for the financial sector starts today!

i’m just getting started and create more onchain for sure!

long live ordinals! 🟧 lfg! 🔥

with my best regards,

artography

1729,8074,Bryan Jacoutot,"we have our #bitcoin etf! here's why ethereum is not next...

1) the bitcoin etf was very much a product of federal court pressure. gary gensler said so himself in today's statement announcing the approval:

but for ethereum, all judicial roads still point to it being a clear unregistered security offering (even per the logic in the ripple decision). however, gensler flatly declared bitcoin a commodity in his statement today, and signaled unregistered securities are not in any better position today than they were yesterday ; 

2) proof of stake is a very different creation/consensus mechanism than proof of work. yield generation through pos has a financialization aspect that proof of work mining simply does not have; and (perhaps most importantly)

3) the inclusion of “slashing” by consensus in a pos model makes it ill-suited to etf custody. imagine, for example, having a completely legitimate paper etf claim to eth but your custodian is slashed for whatever reason—does your claim go away? or are they obligated to buy again? dunno, but that is not great in the eyes of regulators of retirement accounts and pensions

the answer is an unequivocal ""yes!"" you can have too much #btc and here are the signs that you may have too much at the current moment.

you have too much #btc when:

1) your quality of life has deteriorated to the point where the usd price has you super stressed at all times, you can't sleep and you are generally miserable all the time;

2) a downward movement of 20% to 30% makes you feel as though your whole life is over and you start entertaining thoughts that #btc is a farce;

3) the downward usd prices cause you to quickly sell, in order to wait for lower prices; 

4) you start following crypto bros and youtube influencers each day in search of instructions and  guidance on what to do with your #btc; 

5) you have zero cash to live your ordinary life. note: many bitcoiners disagree with me on this one, but i'll hold my ground on this. #btc is the world's greatest saving technology. it is not yet the world's greatest spending technology. we still need dirty cash for our daily lives. having the appropriate amount of cash on hand to live your life normally without causing your family to suffer just because your profile picture suddenly has laser eyes is more than ok, it's intelligence. my 2 sats.

at the end of the day, if what we believe to be true about #bitcoin and its potential has merit, having a truck load is simply not necessary. what is more necessary is that you hold on to what you have without selling it. that to me is more important than the quantity, especially at the start of your journey.

in fact, it has grown much more common for major negative or positive news events to have the opposite effect.

the launch of cme futures came just one day after the 2017 top, on december 18th, 2017.

the coinbase ipo launch came on the day of the april 2021 top, april 14th.

an etf launched that purchased cme futures contracts on october 19th, 2021, one day before near cycle top prices then.

the ftx collapse took place over 10 days from november 2nd - 12th, 2022. marking the cycle bottom.

silicon valley bank collapsed on march 10th, 2023, marking an exact local low.

the sec declared 61 altcoins as securities on june 6th, 2023, just before another local low.

and just recently, etfs began trading on january 11th, 2024. 

so far this has marked a local high that has not been surpassed.

1904,8258,RichQuack,"🚨 #cryptomarket: a bit of a rollercoaster! 🎢

the #crypto market cap (totalcap) had a moment in the sun but then slipped back down to familiar territory.
 #bitcoin ( $btc ), oh bitcoin! it tried to climb past that tricky 0.618 fib level but got a cold shoulder, showing us a not-so-cheery bearish candlestick.

so, what's buzzing in the market?
totalcap and btc both saw a bit of an upswing but couldn't keep the momentum. totalcap couldn't quite stick the landing above $1.61 trillion and took a dive from its $1.81 trillion high.

what's next?
it's a bit of a cliffhanger with totalcap. will it break through the resistance or take another tumble?

and about bitcoin:
 • it got a boost post-etf approval, hitting highs, but then... whoops, down it went, hovering around $42,300.
 • we're all watching to see if it's going to bounce back or slide down even more. could be a 28% dip or a 20% jump – it's all up in the air!

1980,8342,Oliver L. Velez ⚡️ 13%'er Bitcoiner,"there has been quite a focus on greyscale's (gbtc) #btc redemptions, as of late. gbtc is perfectly fine, more than fine. in fact, it's hard to see how any etf will ever catch gbtc's level of #btc holdings at this point. this is the value of being early to a limited supply asset. 

in the same fashion that no one will ever hold 1.1 million #btc as satoshi nakamoto does, i believe no etf will ever hold as much #btc as gbtc does (just under 600,00). i'll even go as far as saying, i don't believe any company will ever hold as much #btc as microstrategy (189,150). once these massive positions are obtained, they are hard to reach due to:

1) the limited supply; 
2) the declining issuance every 4 years; 
3) the continued accumulation by the lead and
4) the rising usd price. 

the united states and bulgaria are neck and neck in the top government holdings categories. bulgaria owns 213,00 #btc at last reporting. this is massive. one county in the near future is likely to position themselves in the lead with an aggressive accumulation plan and when that happens, whoever it is, will seize that lead for good. they will have to debase their own currency (print money) to do it, but micheal saylor is demonstrating to the world via his microstrategy model that this works. issuing more stock (printing) to aquire more #btc is accretive to shareholders, not dilutive.

at some point, we will see a global race on all fronts for some form of #bitcoin lead because it will become increasing clear that once you have it, it's yours for life. individual billionaires, millionaires, companies, funds, and countries will all be at war, biting, scratching and fighting for an asset that is disappearing and is soon to become the hardest money the world has ever known and rhe most valuable item on earth. this is not that far away in my opinion.

are you ready? are you doing enough to front run all of this? you should be, because if i'm right, this will set you up, your family and the generations not yet born forever. you can change your entire bloodline forever, right now. the land grab, or shall i say property grab, we have today, will not last long in my opinion. the hunt is about to be on. so you need to get to work. #stackharder

2181,8559,Oliver L. Velez ⚡️ 13%'er Bitcoiner,"in 15 years, has #bitcoin ever been amassed with this amount of intensity, with this amount of capital? no! do not let the usd price fool you. focus on what is happening with #btc itself. the usd is the age-old trick and wall street in particular has used this ""price trick"" on the public since its inception. i know. i've been a part of that machinery since 1986. 

even other industries use the price trick on you, the regular public. most people have heard the term in real estate called, ""gentrification."" that's when a previously rundown area of a town or city is suddenly bought up on the cheap and rebuilt for a different, higher class of buyer to come in at inflated prices. many of the insiders in on this game will purposely run down an area first. they will pay politicians and the police in an area to not police, so crime rises. they will allow the homeless to proliferate, just to cause prices to first crash and create a mass exodus from the area. then they swoop in, buy up properties dirt cheap and start their rebuilding. this is gentrification at its finest and this blueprint has been used for decades. 

#bitcoin is going through this gentrification process right now. the game is to use the falling price to have you flee #bitcoin land, all while they massively scoop up the property you're abandoning on the cheap. they will use the ftx liquidations and the mt. gox scare to have you run down the prices via your panic. don't fall for the ""price trick,"" this ""gentrification"" scam. they are buying. don't you see below? 👇🏽

the halving is right around the corner. it's a presidential election year in the u.s. interest rates will be lowered this year. printing will begin to skyrocket again. supply on exchanges are at the lowest levels in years and the hodl rate is at record highs. don't you see? the #bitcoin wallets of their freshly formed entities (etfs) are rising throughout all of this, in your face, and some of you are still bickering about $32k, $25k, market top, etf dud, etc. you're not paying attention, anon, and they are counting on this, just like they always do. 

i'm dedicating myself to ensure that those who have eyes to see and ears to hear heed this message and don't get left behind. we get one chance at this. only one chance to change the trajectory of our bloodline.

2306,8689,Rip VanWinkle ⚡️,"if you support a blockchain (other than #btc) that claims to be money, your project is f*cked. 

if the community around your chain is a ""move fast and break things"" type of community, they are necessarily centralized. you have to operate like a company to move this fast. no one will adopt a centralized coin as their money. 

on the other hand, if they do a fair launch like #bitcoin's and move slowly, they will never catch up to btc.

as an owner of #btc, why would i move my funds to a less secure chain? why would i buy a coin with less liquidity? why would i switch to a coin with a smaller network of users and hope it catches up? i already hold the most liquid, most secure coin with the largest network effect. history does not support people ditching the dominant network for an upstart network. 

people like to bring up myspace being overtaken by facebook. this is an apples to oranges comparison because it cost nothing to spin up a facebook account and still keep your myspace account, which is what everyone did. only when all of their friends moved to facebook did they ditch myspace. 

money is different because any value stored in bitcoin is value not stored in another coin. the same value cannot be stored in two assets at the same time. there is a cost to switching your money. 

people won't ditch bitcoin en masse for any specific features (bells n whistles) of another project either. history supports those features migrating to bitcoin, in the same way that the key breakthrough of clubhouse did not cause an exodus from twitter. instead, it was copied and introduced as twitter spaces on the dominant platform. 

this is how bitcoin will evolve over time. owning it now is not only a call option on the collapse of the fiat system and the inevitable adoption of bitcoin, it is also a call option on useful innovations from the crypto space.

it really is true that all roads lead to bitcoin.

focus on log time to understand, my children. that is what counts. that is what btc time is. it is the time of mountains and rivers and stars and cities. log time, the time of giants. 

nothing has changed for btc. it is the usual thing. it simply facing bigger and bigger challenges that btc deals with in the same way when it was a little baby.

the following four books would be a good start in my opinion: 

the bitcoin standard by @saifedean is a must. it's the bible and should be the cornerstone of any #btc library. it is responsible for orange-pilling the majority of bitcoiners after the year 2017 or so. 

proof of money by @proofofmoney was such a joy i have gone through it twice. it helped sharpen my fundamental knowledge of btc's amazing  characteristics and the laws that make it unbeatable. 

bitcoin evangelism by @briandemint is truly one of the best places to start the journey in my opinion. it's thorough, fun to read and packed with pure signal. 

bitcoin: hard money you can't f*ck with by @goingparabolic read like a novel that kept me on the edge of my seat. it's super fun and almost instantly turns one into a hardcore bitcoiner. they all have their place. get them. 

i use audio versions of these during my cardio and workout sessions. i use the kindle versions of these during my alone time, which i plan out each day. i use both versions during my frequent plane trips. this is why i usually get both versions when they are available. 

once these are consumed there is another deeper level of reading i recommend, a level that will take you down into the esoteric depths of #bitcoin. i'll share that list one day as well. in the meantime, i hope this helps. 🙏🏽 #stackharder",2024-01-30 17:18:00,False,269,58,43,2024,BTC,positive,0.9406028,0.004848503,0.05454876

2365,8754,Bit Paine ⚡️,"🚨 unpopular opinion 🚨 

while self-custody is undeniably the ideal, adoption through the etfs is a massive net good for #bitcoin.

what people miss is that this is not @fidelity or @blackrock holding the underlying #btc: the rights to these coins belong to thousands - eventually millions - of individual asset holders who are now financially invested in the success of the asset; many of whom were not before. broadening ✨skin-in-the-game ✨ is key. moreso than any technical advancement.

while cryptography provides technical seizure resistance to #bitcoin, adoption, i.e. ✨expanding the number of individual stakeholders ✨ (which the etfs will do), provides social and political seizure resistance.

while many of you may yearn for the day that governments attempt to seize #bitcoin and your self-custodied coins remain in your possession (and you become a fugitive from the law, unable to spend them, except for e.coli-filled unpasteurized milk and mediocre grass-fed beef at your local farmers’ market), i would prefer an alternative world where any attempt at government seizure results in mass outrage and a massive lawsuit led by blackrock, fidelity, $mstr and millions of #bitcoin-invested stakeholders that simply stops the government in its tracks.

seizure resistance is not just a technical feature of #bitcoin, but a social one as well. and social seizure resistance depends on as many people holding #bitcoin as possible, etfs or not. the government is not all-powerful, and if you view them as such, you’ve already admitted the defeat of #bitcoin and sought refuge in the robustness of its marginalization.",2024-01-30 16:16:00,False,483,48,99,2024,BTC,neutral,0.17783055,0.25116926,0.5710002

2376,8765,Vini Barbosa,"imo, #bitcoin is one of the main reasons why decentralized peer-to-peer money has not yet been significantly adopted.

the #btc protocol disincentives its use by design.

who remembers when steam adopted btc and quickly stepped back due to high fees and long confirmation times? +

steam made this ""no longer supporting bitcoin"" announcement on december 6, 2017, when fees topped out at nearly $20/tx. 
https://t.co/j41blbsf6r

unsurprisingly, this wasn't even the worst moment for btc since then.

in april 2021, fees reached an ath of $62.78/tx on average. followed by a peak at $31.14/tx in may 2023 and a higher one of $37.43/tx in december.

personally, i believe this is just the beginning of a much worse scenario in the future.
https://t.co/7btyx11shk

moreover, the gaming platform blamed price volatility amid a long waiting time to conclude the purchases. this is partially due to btc's multiple needed confirmations in a 10-minute block interval.

interestingly, the faster payments are fully settled (irreversibly), the less affected both peers (buyer and seller) are by volatility during the shopping experience.

we are long overdue to stop wasting time with bitcoin and shift our focus to working with efficiently decentralized peer-to-peer money that solves these issues and incentivizes its use.

#nano is my favorite and the one that better addresses each of these problems, imho. that's why i invest my time educating people about its properties and benefits.

but more than just ""educating,"" i already actively use nano on a daily basis. trying to discover ways to effectively rely less on the fiat and banking systems, aiming for more self-sovereignty and better monetary tools with better economic fundamentals.

however, even if you don't like $xno for some reason, there are other projects available, like #monero, #bitcoincash, #litecoin, #dash, etc. which are far better tools for decentralized peer-to-peer money than btc could ever be.

2502,8892,Cole Walmsley,"#bitcoin is going up in value forever and #bitcoin solves inflation.

send this to your friends.

core understandings:

1) money is the good with which we price in all other goods. money by itself is worthless (if you had a bunch of money but couldn’t exchange it for anything, it is useless). money is how we determine the value of other goods, this car is worth this much, a gallon of milk this much, and so on.

2) there will only ever be 21 million #bitcoin 

let’s say there are 100 money units in circulation in an economy. 

everything in the economy is priced in those 100 money units. there are 5 houses, 10 cars, and 20 cows, among other goods. 

one house costs 1 money unit, one car costs 0.5 money units, and one cow costs 0.10 money units, which means all the houses together are worth 5 money units, cars 5 money units, and cows 2 money units. 

let’s say the economy was able to increase the production of houses, cars, and cows through the labor of workers and technological advancement, such that there are now 10 houses, 20 cars, and 40 cows.

if there are still 100 money units in circulation, everything in the economy is still priced in those 100 money units.

the value of each house, car, and cow would go down because there are more of those goods available to the economy but the amount of money units in circulation has stayed the same.

for example, housing in total is still valued at 5 money units, but there are now 10 houses. that means each house is worth 0.5 money units vs the original 1 money unit.

this results in two things: 

1) houses are more affordable as they have become more abundant, providing not only the economy’s inhabitants with more shelter, but the shelter itself has actually become cheaper, enabling more inhabitants to cost effectively purchase shelter, allowing more inhabitants to be protected from the environment, which allows more inhabitants to spend more time producing and providing value instead of having to worry about sheltering themselves, which would provide more resources to the economy to further boost the production of housing, which would further increase the supply of homes, allowing them to become even more abundant and even more cheaper.

2) whereas 1 money unit used to be able to buy you only one house, now that the prosperity of the economy has gone up in the form of an increased supply of housing, 1 money unit can buy you two houses. this means that the money units have gone up in value, as they can buy you more things.

here's the crazy part...

that's if the housing in total remains valued at 5 money units.

remember, money is the good with which we price in all other goods. if we have a fixed amount of money, all the goods in the economy will always add up in value to the fixed amount of money.

theoretically, and historically, over time, new goods emerge on the market to which the economic users value. in 2006, the iphone didn't exist. in 2007, the iphone existed.

in this fixed 100 money unit scenario, as housing becomes more abundant in supply, the price of each home goes down.

but as new goods arise, such as the iphone, value from still that fixed 100 money unit supply gets pulled out of previous goods and placed into the new goods.

the value that is to be assigned to new goods has to come from somewhere. 

in a fixed supply of money, that value gets extracted from previous goods and assigned to the new goods, lowering the price of previous goods even further.

in the 100 money unit scenario, new goods will emerge, and value will get extracted from previous goods, in this case, housing, and placed into the new goods.

this means that not only are there more houses represented by the same 100 money units (because of the increase in production), which drives the price of each house down, but there are new goods that emerge in the economy to which people give value to, which means value previously assigned to housing now gets allocated to the new goods, which further drives down the total value of housing and the price of a home, which further increases abundance, which further increases the prosperity of the economy and its inhabitants, which further increases the purchasing power of each money unit.

this is why #bitcoin is going up in value forever.

there are only 21 million bitcoins that will ever be in existence. 

everything in the world will be priced in those 21 million bitcoins.

as the world provides more production and prosperity in the form of labor and technological advancement, the supply of goods becomes more abundant.

because the goods are more abundant, but the fixed amount of 21 million bitcoins remains, the price of each of those goods goes down, which increases the purchasing power of each unit of bitcoin.

as time goes on, this trend will continue as society further advances technology, which further increases the output of humanity, making goods more abundant and creating new goods which have value, which brings the price of all other goods down, which further increases the purchasing power of each unit of bitcoin.

this is also how #bitcoin solves inflation.

inflation occurs because new money is created and the rate of that new money creation outpaces the growth in production.

prices go up because the supply of money goes up.

while the prices of goods should be going down in accordance with the increase in production and abundance, in an inflationary monetary system, this is not the case, because those goods are priced in an increasing amount of money.

inflation is both robbing the production of humanity and robbing the purchasing power of the money, making life more expensive in the process.

have you ever wondered...

if humanity is producing more and better things and advancing technology, how is life getting more expensive?

the pricing of that increase in production in an inflationary monetary system is how life is getting more expensive.

notice the graph below. pricing housing in the inflationary monetary system (the u.s. dollar) results in the price increasing, making homes less affordable. pricing housing in the fixed supply, *deflationary* monetary system (bitcoin) results in the price decreasing, making homes more affordable.

#bitcoin is the solution. #bitcoin is the fixed supply monetary system humanity has been waiting for.

we can now accurately price in our advancements in technology and increases in production, allowing life to become more affordable and allowing our money to grow in value forever.

this is why they say infinity divided by 21 million #bitcoin .

the possible production, technological advancement, and prosperity humanity can create is infinite. how much prosperity will have been created in 250,000 years? we can't possibly know the answer other than that it's infinite.

prosperity is infinite, but there will only ever be 21 million #bitcoin to price in that prosperity.

what is infinity divided by any number?

infinity.

2521,8912,CleanSpark Inc.,"introducing our january 2024 monthly mining update, with more operating hashrate on the horizon 🌄:

*monthly #bitcoin production: 577
*total #btc holdings: 3,573
*deployed fleet: 89,237
*month-end fleet #efficiency: 26.4 j/th
*current #hashrate: 10.09 eh/s

crews in sandersville are racking machines in preparation for a february 6 energization date. the first 100 mw are expected to be fully live by mid-february, delivering an expected hashrate of 4.6 eh/s. the remaining 50mw of the expansion is undergoing equipment testing by the manufacturer.

in addition, permitting is underway for the expansion of $clsk's dalton campus. the 15mw expansion is expected to double the operating hashrate there to 1.6 eh/s.

“we have a unique relationship with the city of dalton, which owns and operates its own utility, whereby we are compensated to operate as the city’s only interruptible load during times of emergency power needs. we view this as a best-in-class partnership and as an example of some of the creative ways that bitcoin miners are working with utilities to improve grid performance, even in regulated markets like georgia.” -@zachkbradford, ceo

2578,8972,Oliver L. Velez ⚡️ 13%'er Bitcoiner,"we nailed this bottom pretty nicely. see the yellow arrow depicting my lowest buy point. i saw many of you doing the same, and that is to be congratulated. 👏🏽 kudos!

when i made the call that #btc    would never see prices below $20k again for the rest of eternity, many didn't believe me. some still don't. some people (can we call them that?) are still waiting for $3k.

when i made the call that #btc    would never see prices below $30k again, the hate really poured in. i was told by scores of people that this was said many times before and wasn't true. my response at the time was, ""well, i didn't say it until now, so it's different this time."" 😁 so far it was. 

well, here we are just under $45k, and i'm about to pull the trigger on $40k. i'm willing to bet that the world, as long as it lasts, will never see prices below $40k again. in truth. i need #btc    to strongly break through $45k first, but this might happen today. so here it is. 👇🏽

you will never be able to buy #btc    below $40k for as long as you are alive. you've lost your opportunity forever. 

let's see if i'm right. in fact, i hope i'm wrong. i love cheap sats, but i don't think im wrong. now watch the hate flow from all those who have little to no #btc    exposure because they are preoccupied with pennies in a multi-million dollar game. 

#btc is going to $1 million and more in dollar denominated terms, and people are still worried about this penny level.  at the end of the day, price does not matter now. the only thing that matters is that the number of satoshis you own goes up every single week of your life for the foreseeable future. that's all that matters.

at any rate, no matter how you look at it, we are super early. those who believe that #btc's best years are behind it are highly regarded, in my view. it's barely begun. just look. 

and if history is any guide (and it is), it's always the middle of the macro adoption curve that is the most exponential, not the beginning. with less than 1% of the entire world in #bitcoin, how can one say we're anywhere near the middle of it's adoption. you can't.

that’s hyper-bitcoinization. a day when trust in decentralized digital gold surpasses the crumbling faith in worthless printed paper. it's not just a shift in assets, it's a paradigm shift in belief systems. and it may coming sooner than we think. 

in this new era, #bitcoin isn't just a new form of money, it's a statement, a way of life, a loud rejection of the traditional financial system's shortcomings. this is the future we are steadily moving towards, steadily, patiently, unrelenting, one block at a time.

2685,9081,Ordiswap,"revolutionizing bitcoin defi, from bitvm to ordiswap 🧪:

→ ordiswap 🧪 is proud to be the 1st ever dapp in #btc history that has ported over evm logic on native #bitcoin l1 🧡

→ one of the biggest advancements in the btc space was the release of the bitvm whitepaper in october 2023, by developer robin linus. it highlighted new ways to implement dynamic smart contracts using the existing l1 infrastructure.

→ prior to this, taproot upgrade, and the launch of ordinals, brc-20 standards in 2023, have unleashed a flurry of builder interest in bitcoin — catalyzing fresh momentum in network activity ❌. but, transactions were limited over marketplaces + otc. defi still needed expressive smart contracts, and the bitcoin l1 had limited technical capabilities on that front.

→ 📜 the bitvm thesis aimed to implement dynamic smart contracts by scaling complex computations off-chain, and enabling participants to settle with the bitcoin code smoothly, and resolve in case of disputes. 💡 think optimistic rollups on ethereum. bitvm requires no modifications on the bitcoin consensus rules and are based almost exclusively on existing primitives like hashlocks and timelocks.

→ until now, there have been no working bitvm implementations, as all “bitcoin-native defi” have either relied on l2s or rollups.

→ ordiswap 🧪 changes all of this. btcfi starts today.

dissecting ordiswap’s tech ⚙️:

→ ordiswap expands on the concept of “off-chain balance states” — a novel mechanism that manages user balances and interactions with periodic settlements on bitcoin. these transactions inherit the security and finality of bitcoin.

→ ordiswap's amm leverages @uniswap v2's constant product formula to ensure fairness and efficiency in token trades with minimized slippage. users can create pools in a permissionless manner, provide liquidity and stake to earn yields.

→ ordiswap is thus the 1st protocol to also enable lp tokens to exist on native #bitcoin 💧

→ there is seamless interoperability with the evm ecosystem, with cross-chain swaps enabled via the highly liquid @thorchain pools. no bridges, no l2s, no problem.

what does this unlock 🔓❓

→ an efficient, low-slippage, interoperable infrastructure which will allow a thousand defi primitives to bloom on bitcoin. expect yield farms, decentralized lending markets etc.

→ ordiswap lp tokens can be plugged into all different types of defi applications, opening up a whole new world of composability and network effects. the first step to the btcfi summer? 🌞

→ no more fractured liquidity. with easy avenues to bridge to l1, liquidity is coming home to bitcoin. no more reliance on marketplaces or over-the-counter (otc) trades.

ordiswap, a full-stack bitcoin infrastructure behemoth 🔄:

→ ordiswap goes beyond just an amm, but rather an enitre emerging full-stack infrastructure ecosystem for bitcoin defi that aims to completely redefine liquidity dynamics on the native layer.

→ ordilayer, a proprietary layer-2 designed for future proof scalability and applications

→ ordipad, a brc-20 launchpad, with token launches accessible to $ords & $reos holders

→ btsd, an over-collateralized & decentralized stablecoin that implements aspects of successful stability models like @makerdao

→ ordiswap foundation, and much more...

→ amm stage 2 build coming very soon 👀

3035,9443,Oliver L. Velez ⚡️ 13%'er Bitcoiner,"interesting #bitcoin    fact:

on august 15, 2010, due to a bug in #btc   's code, a transaction created 184 billion btc in block 74638. this event was dubbed the ""value overflow incident."" it was solved by the bitcoin community with a soft fork that invalidated the extra #btc    and quickly restored the blockchain to its intended state. this would be the last and final time the #bitcoin    protocol would see an interruption. it fixed the problem forever. 

this is my take:

i believe to this very day that this was planned by satoshi nakamoto. here me out on this. 👇🏽

you see, 40 years earlier to the very day, president richard nixon announced the suspension of the convertibility of the u.s. dollar into gold. he did that on august 15, 1971. 🤯 this decision effectively ended the bretton woods system of international financial exchange and led to the transition to the global fiat currency system.m we know today. this event is commonly referred to as the “nixon shock.”

i believe satoshi wanted to remind us what #bitcoin    is here to solve a d chose this historical ""fist"" day to demonstrate that #bitcoin    fixes the ""nixon shock."" once #btc    fixed it, it would never be dow and never have a single hiccup for a single second, ever again.

i could be off my rocker, but i really don't think so. what i've grown to realize is that satoshi nakamoto did nothing without deep meaning. every number, every choice, every decision is infused with deep meaning. i believe this inflation bug on the very day massive inflation was born is not a coincidence. it's not by chance. satoshi was this careful and purposeful.

that's my 2 sats, and i'm sticking with it. what are your thoughts? 👇🏽",2024-02-22 23:48:00,False,371,36,52,2024,BTC,neutral,0.27230072,0.11559077,0.61210847

3046,9454,Beanie,"satoshi emails on the tl today. i’ll tell you who i think it is👇

while hal finney is the bitcoin bull case, i’ve spent years digging into the origin of satoshi. i’ve read everything i could find and watched countless shows and even foreign documentaries about this topic. i remain pretty convinced that satoshi is paul le roux.

main evidence being the fact that satoshi went dark literally right before le roux was apprehended in liberia. satoshi was very active in emails, forum and newsgroups. never to be heard from again.

le roux of course is in prison for multiple major crimes. and will be at least for the next 20 years. he did go on a rant about bitcoin at his sentencing hearing a few years ago.

bitcoin client contained a poker source code. le roux worked as a dev at an offshore gambling operation in costa rica prior to moving to the philippines. about the same time bodog did.

i think le roux worked for bodog in costa rica which would have connected him with csw. not entirely sure but recall reading about that connection somewhere at one point.

in philippines during the first year or two of bitcoin when satoshi mined over a million coins, le roux was questioned about his extraordinary power use.

this is covered in a philippines public television network show about le roux. had nothing to do with satoshi. it was about his plotting of a murder of a local real estate agent there. they probably thought he was growing marijuana or something. but the times line up to when those coins were mined.

le roux developed e4m encryption software. and rumored to have been a part of truecrypt, which to this day forms the base of the encryption software used by terrorist groups like al queda for private messaging. it hasn’t been cracked.

both of these softwares are open source, just like bitcoin. i’m not a coder, but ones i have spoken to say that both e4m and the bitcoin source code are highly advanced c++.

apparantly there’s not a whole lot of people capable of coding either. elon musk was rumored to be satoshi at one point simply due to his c++ coding skill. not many exist that are capable of coding something like bitcoin.

bitcoin was coded between the time that le roux shut down his affiliate program network. likely because of troubles with credit card processing. same as he experienced in the gambling business. giving him the motivation to explore digital currencies as a form of payment. which is the thesis of the bitcoin whitepaper. transfer of digital cash for payments. not digital gold like the new narrative.

circumstantially, if you read le roux’s ramblings on usenet going back all the way into the 90s, he’s quite libertarian and uses the same style of half british, half american english that satoshi does. time zones of posts match up also to somebody that would have been living in the philippines at the time of most activity.

satoshi was a prolific poster with a similar flair of arrogance as le roux had on newsgroups when touting e4m. and then satoshi just stopped posting. very out of character.

le roux also was found with a fake passport with the name “solotoshi”. which doesn’t prove anything but is an interesting coincidence.

there’s alot more. and you can easily fall down this rabbit hole like i did. there’s no actual smoking gun here but i feel like le roux had the very specific c++ supercoder skills that not many possess, and the motivation after struggling with online payments always, plus the mindset of a very extreme libertarian.",2024-02-23 23:33:00,False,838,88,222,2024,BTC,neutral,0.09380943,0.29511917,0.6110714

crypto twitter is basically silent because they sold their coins to the bankers. you can't really blame them, because  the sec only passed the etf 3 votes to 2. and usually crypto has dumped for such large events. also there's the fear of sales, say for instance mt.gox, that's been pretending to be a sell event for like 10 years now...

now that wall street is on board, if it continues like it has been, they could likely absorb all the sales anyway.

which leaves you here. you've been a bull market for a year and a half in btc.

3275,9826,👑Crypto Caesar👑™️,"🌛🌛🌛altcoins analysis 🌜🌜🌜

as far as the #altcoin market goes you are still quite early. why? purely because #btc.d is still very high. this means the #altcoin market hasn’t even started the ‘mania phase’ yet.

the  ‘mania phase’ begins when #btc.d starts to drop sharply. this occurs when market participants are willing to take on more risk and liquidity moves into #altcoins from #bitcoin, stable coins and fiat. this increases the market caps of #altcoins thus reducing #btc.d. 

this doesn’t mean #bitcoin’s price drops. quite the contrary as #bitcoin will continue in its own ‘mania phase’ to the upside. what it means is, as dominance falls and liquidity flows into #alts the market is willing to take on more risk. hence the reason why #btc.d is always very low at the peak of every market or the end of any ‘mania phase’. 

this metric is actually a good indicator to signal a potential market top. as you can see in the chart during every market top #btc.d has been within a range of 35-39%. 

what this chart is telling us now is #btc.d is beginning to top out and it will soon begin its decline to the downside. i still think we might have a little more upside before this capitulation of dominance begins. possibly 58%. 

either way my view is that we are very close to the beginnings of a big #altseason and indeed the ‘mania phase’. 

at caesar capital we will be watching very closely if/when #btc.d enters the ‘death zone’ on the chart below as this could be a strong indication of a market top.",2024-03-10 16:42:00,False,572,121,50,2024,BTC,neutral,0.24790315,0.144421,0.60767585

how?
- the #btc oracle acts as a zero knoweldge proof (zpk) data feed that provides real-time bitcoin information to smart contracts (evm contract) on a blockchain.

- it inputs various types of bitcoin-related information, such as transfer, ordinals, and txscripts information, which could be used by decentralised applications (dapps) for functions like btc lending, brc20 indexing, algorithmic stable coin issuance.

- the evm (ethereum virtual machine) contract interacts with this data uses zkps (zero-knowledge proofs) to verify the integrity and correctness of the data without revealing underlying information.

there are three main layers:
1) application layer (dapps like wbtc, lending, stablecoin) – provides various decentralised services on any blockchain.

2) $ela relayers network – acts as the execution layer, ensuring that transactions are correctly executed and liquidated when necessary. they act as guardians of transactions.

3) #btc oracle network – generates zkps and transmits events from btc to the evm contract, allowing off-chain data (like bitcoin price) to influence smart contract operations. this is facilitated through zk proofs and a one time sign mechanism.

3323,9874,danny huuep,"on long term value in bitcoin ordinals 👇

bitcoin is valuable long term because it is a standard for a fungible digital asset. the whole world knows and can agree on what a bitcoin is, and how it works.
ordinals can be long term valuable for a nonfungible digital asset if it becomes a standard. first, it is *extremely* hard to build anything on top of bitcoin because of bitcoin's limited programmability, and even harder to create a standard on top of bitcoin.

casey has pulled off a miracle in standardizing a few things to create ordinals. to understand what is actually long term valuable, it's important to understand what has been standardized. not everything about ordinals is a standard, and anything that is not standard will have a sharp decline in value in the long term.
take the concept of a collection. the standard way to create a collection in ordinals took over a year to implement and get the market to adopt, and this was pushed hard by casey, the creator of ordinals, and many market participants. that collection standard of ordinals is parent-child provenance.

to create a new collection standard and to get the whole world to adopt it as a new standard in ordinals is unlikely at this point.

incidentally, there are actually a few indirect ways to ""create"" a collection in ordinals that are part of the standards of ordinals or bitcoin.

1. low inscription numbers. ordinals has standardized the inscription, so the first 1,000 inscriptions, or the first 10,000 inscriptions are built in ""collections"" that follow standards set by ordinals. we already see increased value for inscriptions in these low inscription number ""collections.""

2. cursed inscriptions. before inscriptions themselves became a standard, some inscriptions were ignored. these were given a ""cursed"" status as part of the ordinals standardization in january 2024 (the jubilee). these now form a cursed ""collection."" cursed inscriptions can also be numbered, so there will be a low cursed inscription number ""collection"" that will form and have long term value.

3. inscriptions on sequential sats. sat numbering is a standard in ordinals, and inscriptions that are inscribed on a sequential sat range can form a collection that is easily recognized in the standard ordinals.

4. inscriptions created in a single block or single transaction. these form a ""collection"" because of the standards of bitcoin.

5. inscriptions created on certain types of sats. uncommons, block 9, 450x, pizza.

there are other related ways to form collections using existing standards, or combinations of them. these can help ""collections"" that were created before the parent-child provenance collection standard. 👉for future collections, using the standard way to create a collection is essential for the long term value of that collection.

for the ocm genesis collection, we focused on creating a collection with long term value, and it took over two years to create this collection on bitcoin. we worked with the ordinals team on the collection standard, and used parent-child provenance for ocm genesis. in addition, we used sequential sat numbers (45017800001-45017810000), and the parent inscription that contained the art of the whole 10k collection had a low inscription number (20219). the collection was batch inscribed so the multi inscription transactions grouped the collection from bitcoin transactions. we were the first to do these things, and ended up being ""cursed"" multiple times, the most cursed collection of 10k on block 9, 450x sats. 

ocm genesis is a remarkable 10k collection on bitcoin, and the first and only 10k parent-child provenance collection created in 2023. first and cursed.👹",2024-03-15 18:24:00,False,425,132,96,2024,BTC,neutral,0.1264941,0.29744914,0.5760568

3346,9898,BTC_POWER_LAW / PlanG,"#btc the only missing piece of the btc power law theory was the bubbles. now i think i got what causes them. here it is:
1. the halving causes a decrease in reward for the miners. this eliminates some weak links in the system and the system needs to respond with an increase in hashing power to adapt to this change otherwise they cannot achieve similar revenues before the halvings. 
2. this increase in hashing power brings more security to the system that increases the number of users users=hashrate^1/4 (even if it looks like fomo, the halvings causes an inflow of new users). 
3. because of the sudden changes this is less of the organic continuous inflow of users that is typical of times when we are in a bubble so the system overshoots and it goes into a bubble type of behavior. 
4. hash rate cannot follow this overshot and it de-couples from the very top of the bubble (hash-rate doesn't follow the most extreme part of the bubble because it takes time to buy new machines, make investment in real estate and infrastructure and so on).
5. the bubble crashes and it goes back to the hard baseline where mining is barely profitable.

to increase profitability in 2024, the company purchased two facilities in texas and nebraska, totalling 390 mw for a total cash purchase of $178.6m ($458k per mw) from @generatecapital, in january 2024 and will take full control from @hut8corp with effect april 30, 2024.  

a second purchase to acquire the 200 mw garden city facility, in texas from @applieddigital for a total of $87.3 million ($437k per mw) in cash to take its infrastructure owned business to approximately 54%.

3565,10121,Daniel Batten,"you’ve probably seen greenpeaceusa's bitcoin report by now, and my response (if you haven't been blocked).

here’s six things that every environmentalist, bitcoin advocate, regulator, policymaker and media representative should know about greenpeaceusa. 

i've had this information for over a year, but have held back on going public with it until now because there were initially signs that greenpeaceusa would be open to engaging with environmentalists within the bitcoin community. 

with them now blocking me from commenting on their posts, all hope of that has now ended. 

so here's what i can tell you about greenpeaceusa, and their campaign that have not been aired publicly until now, and which may surprise you.

firstly, some context: i’m a former volunteer environmental campaigner with greenpeace.

i once risked arrest to stand up for causes i believed in, including an anti-gmo campaign against mcdonalds which was successful within 6 weeks, and hailed as an example of how creative direct action can yield fast results. 

one of the differences: we talked to mcdonalds (something no one at greenpeaceusa is currently doing with the bitcoin community). 

i know a number of people in the environmental movement, and i would like to thank them for their honesty in whistleblowing on a thoroughly misguided campaign from greenpeaceusa from start to finish.

1. greenpeaceusa’s campaign does not have the backing of greenpeace international. in fact, other branches have asked questions of greenpeaceusa’s tactics, and even said that their campaign is damaging the greenpeace brand, and has resulted in the loss of subscriptions.

2. within greenpeaceusa, there are a growing number of voices of discontent. there is a growing division between some of the younger crypto-neutral or crypto-friendly millennial in their base, and the directorship of greenpeaceusa

3. as we know, greenpeaceusa did receive a $5million donation from ripple’s chair chris larsen to run an anti-bitcoin campaign. what you probably do not know is that within greenpeace, several staff have questioned whether this is ethical, or in the spirit of an organization that says it relies only on grassroots funding in its sign-up pledge.

4. some members of ewg and sierraclub, particularly younger members, were not enamoured with their organization’s collusion with greenpeaceusa’s “change the code” campaign. ewg has not engaged in anti-bitcoin rhetoric since 6 april ‘23.

5. the head of greenpeaceusa’s “change the code” campaign has stepped down and is no longer any part of greenpeaceusa. at the time of his stepping down he was reported by a source within greenpeaceusa to be questioning the wisdom of the campaign.

6. within greenpeaceusa, we know from multiple inside sources that the change the code campaign has been widely acknowledged to have been “not particularly successful”. 

greenpeaceusa’s campaign got off on the wrong foot right from the start, by antagonising environmentalists within the bitcoin community, such as me. here’s its half-time report (tl;dr, the worst performing environmental campaign i’ve ever witnessed).
https://t.co/apas7hdipk

now, the campaign is in more disarray than ever, resorting to tenuous ad hominem attacks against satoshi action, based on the discover that one of their supporters is a climate denier. true. well, guess what: one of their supporters is also a plant-based, tree-hugging, climate-activist & meditation teacher: me. 

that’s the beauty of bitcoin: it pulls people in from across the political spectrum: we are as diverse as society itself, and that’s what makes us strong. as i wrote recently, “when the ship you’re standing on is sinking: it doesn’t matter if you’re on the left of right side of it.”

i hoped greenpeaceusa would end their anti-bitcoin campaign before their credibility and relevance to the new generation of millennials they are currently disenfranchising is completely severed. but it seems at the moment they are more intent on doubling down on misinformation. their leadership must change for them to ever have hope of becoming a true voice for the environment again.",2024-03-20 22:01:00,False,942,252,34,2024,BTC,neutral,0.078129634,0.4012499,0.52062047

3657,10219,Bit Paine ⚡️,"how to think about #bitcoin bull markets and the halving: 🧵 

we are not yet in a bull market. how do i know? 

because bull markets in #bitcoin are mass psychological phenomena. they are the periodic, large-scale repricing of an exponential asset as it enters a new psychological range in the human mind,  which intuits value within a linear space.

the idea that something might be worth 2x or 0.5x what it is currently valued is intuitive. the idea that something might be 10x or 100x more valuable is not. it requires a step-change in perception, and it happens when the market overcomes mass psychological resistance.

what causes this? well, the halving (obviously), but it’s more than just the halving.

from the very inception of #bitcoin there were, broadly, two groups of adopters: true believers, and open-minded skeptics. 

there is obviously somewhat of a continuum between these groups, but it is not clinal.

the “true believer” coins are psychologically separable and remain highly illiquid across 5+ years. very few of them move, even in bull markets. think @saylor, think @maxkeiser, think satoshi. 

“lost” coins fall into this group for all intents and purposes - and the sheer volume (millions!!!) of lost coins during #bitcoin’s early history account for the rapid rise in value in its early years. 

additionally, the relative proportion of coins held by “true believer” types was quite high because you had to be a relatively niche person ideologically to have even heard of #bitcoin in, say, 2012. 

people in this group are hodling forever. they may sell a bit during bull markets in order to buy things (guns perhaps, a citadel in el salvador), but they’re not diversifying or rotating their profits into crypto or other fiat investments.

this is contrasted with the #btc that are actively traded within the broader “crypto” ecosystem, which are primarily held by “cycle timing” traders and other degenerates, and which remain relatively liquid within and particularly between cycles. i think we have seen diminishing returns on #btc over the past two cycles largely because the coinbase-led crypto casino-shitcoin-industrial complex expanded the relative volume of coins held by this demographic. 

another way to think of this is that everyone pays the market price for their #bitcoin, but there is one group who assigns it a much higher value and in terms of where they might be willing to sell. 

like all markets there will be a psychological equilibrium that develops between these groups during a cycle. 

newly mined coins are for all intents and purposes sold into the market every day - as we’ve established, miners are demand-side, not supply-side - and because #bitcoin is the revenue from which they must pay costs in a competitive and volatile market, these coins are highly liquid, with some steady state of coins flowing from weak (trader) to stronger (true believer) hands but being replenished by newly-mined #btc.

this is where the halving comes in: when the flow into the pool of highly-liquid #btc halves, this accelerates the rate at which the pool of highly-liquid coins drains into the pool of highly-illiquid coins and massively alters the market equilibrium. it acts like a price-insensitive buyer coming in and buying half of the replenishing flow into that pool.

that pool - the liquid pool - is what determines the price as price is inherently liquidity-weighted. 

at some point post-halving, that pool drains to the point of forcing a mass psychological upward dislocation from an established linear range closer to the value assigned to #btc by the “true believers,” which is upward to infinity on an exponential trajectory.

3718,10282,Luke Broyles,"$1 billion #bitcoin is not bullish.

let's say you are 20 (or you have a 20 year old kid).

you've got 45 years until you're 65.

let's say #bitcoin has a 24% cagr for 45 years... forget that #btc's historical cagr is ridiculously higher, that 99% of capital is ahead of us, market multiplier only goes up from here, and that fiat debasement only accelerates.

that is $1,119,628,313 per #btc upon age 65.

you've still got 20+ years to live... remember that by 2069 life expectancy will hopefully be significantly longer!

if we assume a cagr of 30% and you live to 100 that is $1,869,818,789,476,726 per #bitcoin.

is a $1.8 quadrillion #btc sustainable in real terms?🤣

ok, how about nominal terms?🤔

how do we price future tech in terms of current tech?🤯

""you're crazy""... ok... my grandmother is 92 years old and the s&p 500 was literally $4 when she was born. 👀

the stock market did a 1,200x in 92 years despite:
slower tech innovation,
non-finite market cap,
lower systemic usd inflation,
only exposure to a portion of the usa,
only 1/20th of the humans having property rights,
& starting out with a major share of global wealth.

even if you think i'm insane it is a fact if the s&p 500 simply kept pace with the last 100 years it would be $75 million in the next century... from increased tech and inflation alone the s&p 500 is going to hundreds of millions of usd political currency units (even though #bitcoin demonetizes it).

who knows how this plays out but you'll may live to see #bitcoin at almost every fiat price point you can imagine... even if the usd doesn't hyperinflate.

forget $1.8 quadrillion #bitcoin.
forget $1 billion #bitcoin.
forget $100 million #bitcoin.

if #bitcoin went to $2 million in the next few years are you **seriously** prepared?...

1) do you have multiple self-custody setups?

2) have you reduced single points of failure (including you?)

3) do you even have self custody?

4) are you protected against theft, lost keys, or passing?

5) do you have jurisdictional arbitrage? keys in multiple countries?

6) will your spouse, partner, or kids have the ability and education to manage $10's of millions worth of #bitcoin alone in a few years if they needed to?

7) do you have #bitcoin in your ira, smsf, pension, or trust yet?

8) do you still have single-sig wallets/devices in your house or ""safety"" deposit box?

9) do you realize that all of these things are easily possible for you? it doesn't matter if you only have ""a little"" #btc you still have signifigant wealth.

10) do you have any exposure to the lowest risk institutional-grade multi-sig collaborative custody?... how do you expect to get the best terms or most favorable treatment otherwise if you don't?

have you yet asked yourself what will happen when millions of people ask themselves these ten questions at once?... do you seriously want to procrastinate this?

maybe we've got 3-5 years before these questions matter... however there are 10 million+ people who will have the need for this and i can assure you @thebtcadviser will be front and center - given a perfect track record since 2016. nobody comes close to what @thebtcadviser has created and it's why i've got my stack in that precise setup.

the reason i talk #bitcoin, self custody, and @thebtcadviser is not because i need to or a lack of demand... it is because i understand we have a massive supply-demand squeeze coming and i'm trying to warn you.

you (and millions of others) don't need a $1 billion or even a $1 million #btc to start feeling significant pressures on peace of mind.

you (and millions of others) don't need 100% exposure to collaborative custody multi-sig to reap of benefits. most won't want to be all-in one model which (in irony) makes the market only bigger and the importance to gain exposure only higher.

even if #bitcoin only goes to $800,000 and you only had 25% in a collaborative custody arrangement the peace of mind, helping hand, and lack of single point of failure is going to be so important.

you've got your hands on #bitcoin right now and don't realize it's like buying the s&p 500 at $4 in 1932... and we are about to accelerate into 2132 tech and prices in the next few decades.

ignore me about #bitcoin, fine. i don't care. just get off zero.🫡

ignore me about self custody, fine. in a long enough time horizon all counter-party risk rises to 100% failure rate and you'll learn then.🙄

ignore me about collaborative custody, fine. we've got plenty of demand. in 5 years people will ask why i didn't warn them to at least consider it.🤷‍♂️

don't worry, other competitors will arise besides @thebtcadviser with legit services for collaborative custody multi-sig... the only difference is they were not helping clients since 2016 and they won't achieve zero single point of failure.

call a $10,000,000 #bitcoin ""moon-math"" all you want but i'm trying to warn you max pain is not down... it is up.

why?

if i had an infinite money printer why would i force #btc price down when i could just force price up faster than the security of hodl'ers self custody? don't scare them out of selling their coins in fear of crash - scare them into selling their coins in the face of green omega candles they weren't prepared for.

we have less in common with the future than the past... the fear of ngu will someday eclipse the fear of ngd.

even if the usd does not hyperinflate and we don't see hyperbitcoinization this is still true - that's how bullish #bitcoin is.

$1 million #bitcoin is nothing and yet most people are not prepared for it - even those that own #bitcoin...

3738,10303,Luke Broyles,"$1 billion #bitcoin is not bullish.

let's say you are 20 (or you have a 20 year old kid).

you've got 45 years until you're 65.

let's say #bitcoin has a 24% cagr for 45 years... forget that #btc's historical cagr is ridiculously higher, that 99% of capital is ahead of us, market multiplier only goes up from here, and that fiat debasement only accelerates.

that is $1,119,628,313 per #btc upon age 65.

you've still got 20+ years to live... remember that by 2069 life expectancy will hopefully be significantly longer!

if we assume a cagr of 30% and you live to 100 that is $1,869,818,789,476,726 per #bitcoin.

is a $1.8 quadrillion #btc sustainable in real terms?🤣

ok, how about nominal terms?🤔

how do we price future tech in terms of current tech?🤯

""you're crazy""... ok... my grandmother is 92 years old and the s&p 500 was literally $4 when she was born. 👀

the stock market did a 1,200x in 92 years despite:
slower tech innovation,
non-finite market cap,
lower systemic usd inflation,
only exposure to a portion of the usa,
only 1/20th of the humans having property rights,
& starting out with a major share of global wealth.

even if you think i'm insane it is a fact if the s&p 500 simply kept pace with the last 100 years it would be $75 million in the next century... from increased tech and inflation alone the s&p 500 is going to hundreds of millions of usd political currency units (even though #bitcoin demonetizes it).

who knows how this plays out but you'll may live to see #bitcoin at almost every fiat price point you can imagine... even if the usd doesn't hyperinflate.

forget $1.8 quadrillion #bitcoin.
forget $1 billion #bitcoin.
forget $100 million #bitcoin.

if #bitcoin went to $2 million in the next few years are you **seriously** prepared?...

1) do you have multiple self-custody setups?

2) have you reduced single points of failure (including you?)

3) do you even have self custody?

4) are you protected against theft, lost keys, or passing?

5) do you have jurisdictional arbitrage? keys in multiple countries?

6) will your spouse, partner, or kids have the ability and education to manage $10's of millions worth of #bitcoin alone in a few years if they needed to?

7) do you have #bitcoin in your ira, smsf, pension, or trust yet?

8) do you still have single-sig wallets/devices in your house or ""safety"" deposit box?

9) do you realize that all of these things are easily possible for you? it doesn't matter if you only have ""a little"" #btc you still have signifigant wealth.

10) do you have any exposure to the lowest risk institutional-grade multi-sig collaborative custody?... how do you expect to get the best terms or most favorable treatment otherwise if you don't?

have you yet asked yourself what will happen when millions of people ask themselves these ten questions at once?... do you seriously want to procrastinate this?

maybe we've got 3-5 years before these questions matter... however there are 10 million+ people who will have the need for this and i can assure you @thebtcadviser will be front and center - given a perfect track record since 2016. nobody comes close to what @thebtcadviser has created and it's why i've got my stack in that precise setup.

the reason i talk #bitcoin, self custody, and @thebtcadviser is not because i need to or a lack of demand... it is because i understand we have a massive supply-demand squeeze coming and i'm trying to warn you.

you (and millions of others) don't need a $1 billion or even a $1 million #btc to start feeling significant pressures on peace of mind.

you (and millions of others) don't need 100% exposure to collaborative custody multi-sig to reap of benefits. most won't want to be all-in one model which (in irony) makes the market only bigger and the importance to gain exposure only higher.

even if #bitcoin only goes to $800,000 and you only had 25% in a collaborative custody arrangement the peace of mind, helping hand, and lack of single point of failure is going to be so important.

you've got your hands on #bitcoin right now and don't realize it's like buying the s&p 500 at $4 in 1932... and we are about to accelerate into 2132 tech and prices in the next few decades.

ignore me about #bitcoin, fine. i don't care. just get off zero.🫡

ignore me about self custody, fine. in a long enough time horizon all counter-party risk rises to 100% failure rate and you'll learn then.🙄

ignore me about collaborative custody, fine. we've got plenty of demand. in 5 years people will ask why i didn't warn them to at least consider it.🤷‍♂️

don't worry, other competitors will arise besides @thebtcadviser with legit services for collaborative custody multi-sig... the only difference is they were not helping clients since 2016 and they won't achieve zero single point of failure.

call a $10,000,000 #bitcoin ""moon-math"" all you want but i'm trying to warn you max pain is not down... it is up.

why?

if i had an infinite money printer why would i force #btc price down when i could just force price up faster than the security of hodl'ers self custody? don't scare them out of selling their coins in fear of crash - scare them into selling their coins in the face of green omega candles they weren't prepared for.

we have less in common with the future than the past... the fear of ngu will someday eclipse the fear of ngd.

even if the usd does not hyperinflate and we don't see hyperbitcoinization this is still true - that's how bullish #bitcoin is.

$1 million #bitcoin is nothing and yet most people are not prepared for it - even those that own #bitcoin...

prepare for a 100x now, because you (or your kids) may live to see a $1 billion #bitcoin... even without hyperinflation.

people today laugh at me because i'm bullish.

in truth, people will laugh at me in the future with how bearish i am because i'm trying to explain 2132 in terms of 1932 prices and tech.

of course not.

it's the most important stock in the history of the stock market.

if #bitcoin is the hardest, best money the world has ever discovered (cultures discover that a commodity has good money utility, it can't be prescribed to them), then $mstr is the first ever company to leverage the only uncorruptible money in the world.

and they're building a monopoly.

the only companies that have the capital to copy the strategy probably won't, and $mstr has a strong lead.

just my personal opinion, not financial advice, but in 10 years $mstr will be the biggest company in terms of market cap, and $tsla will be number 2 (who said there's no second best?🤣)

- obvious (but also)
- non consensus 

the perfect version of that has been the $sol trade 

anyone paying attention could see that solana was still highly active during the bear, but most wrote off the token due to sbf connection... both boxes ticked

now the even better version (aka the ""next sol"") is gaming

gaming is obvious af, everyone gets ""why gaming'

the thing is most people still do not believe that gaming will actually take off 

i hear constant murmurs ""most of these will fail"" ... ""it's just vapor"" ... ""what if activision just adds nfts"" etc

the point is, no one is really pricing in the possibility of mainstream success.

in fact, they cannot comprehend the power of a true crypto product being adopted at scale

his picks cover layer-1, gaming coins and even ai cryptos🤯

here are all 17 projects + @zssbecker comments on each:👇

-------------------

⚙️layer-1⚙️

1. $sol - @solana 

""many people nowadays are skipping $eth and $bnb are go straight down to $sol""

2. $avax - @avax 

""i think $avax is going to flip cardano very soon and it's going to pull up right underneath solana""

🤖ai coins🤖

3. $paal - @paalmind 

""after the recent crypto dip, $paal is in a good buying zone again""

4. $aioz - @aioznetwork 

""aioz network is one project i've added a really large position in. in the past month, $aioz has done really well – despite the market being negative. that's because the tech behind this applied to everything. $aioz should have a market cap similar to $rndr and $tao""

5. $dsync - @destranetwork 

""another position i've added in ai – which i think is the gem of gems – would be destra network. i think $dsync has a very similar chance to do a run very similar to opsec. i also think destra network is very similar to akash network""

6. $opsec - @opseccloud 

""i think opsec is going to a billion dollar market cap. if you see the price action of $opsec of the past month – it's definitely pushing up. this coin has that beach call effect""

🎮crypto gaming🎮

7-8. $beam $super - @buildonbeam @superversedao 

""gaming is very simple. you can literally get $beam and $super and call it a day. that's just a good old basic crypto gaming exposure. i believe $super will have a multi billion dollar market cap because it's integrated in all of gaming crypto""

9-12. $pixel $ron $imx $ilv - @pixels_online @ronin_network @immutable @illuviumio 

""those coins are all fantastic as well""

13. $sfund - @seedifyfund 

""there are some no brainer investment in crypto gaming like seedify - which i think can easily go to $10-$15. you can always put money in $sfund – it just simply works""

14-15. $myria $alu - @myria @alturanft

""i think $myria is super undervalued right now as well as altura - which i think is also massively undervalued right now""

16. $cah - @moontropica 

""the one gaming coin that really stuck out to me recently was moon tropica - because even when bitcoin dumps, $cah just kept going up. one of the reasons i went pretty heavy in $cah is that they got a game, they got all the narratives and the community reminds me of one of the freakiest of memecoin communities""

17. $sidus - @galaxy_sidus

1⃣ thanks to the sweep tax of 2% on every tx, the $dgn dao will regularly sweep nft collections with huge amounts, creating an incentive for traders, dao & founders to hodl $dgn to pump their bags.

2⃣ the swept nfts will be managed by $dgn nft fund
that will allow investors to expose themselves to top solana nft projects with a single asset.

3⃣ the profit generated on the nft fund management will be used to buy back $dgn for the staking pool thus creating a constant buy pressure on the token.

what's happening is your transaction keeps getting forwarded to the next block leader (but not getting included) until the blockhash expires

important: this is not an rpc issue (unless their global coverage is awful and distance to the leader is always far)

patch:

- note it's *impossible* to fully 100% fix this until the solana mainnet scheduler is fully deterministic (release 1.18)
- add fees
- minimize distance to block leader and minimize distance to your rpc nodes from your servers/clients (it's kind of a race)

solana is 3800x faster than ethereum, 10,000x faster than bitcoin

w/ fees @ pennie's or lower

step 1: download a solana wallet, the most used are phantom(https://t.co/uaxgghvbuz) or solflare(https://t.co/osahok2mj9)

step 2: fund your wallet, you can do this from a cex such as coinbase or binance, or through a bridge like allbridge(https://t.co/haebq6lkx2) if you have funds on a different blockchain

step 3: decide what you want to do onchain, solana is ripe with active development in many areas, here are a few:

-staking/validating (@jito_sol, @marinadefinance, @marginfi)
-nfts (@magiceden)
-trading(@jupiterexchange)

step 4: find your community, there are plenty of people exploring and building on solana, either on x or telegram.

let's dive in. 

2024 is a continuation of 2023. bitcoin will cont to steal most of the spotlight until after the havening (imo, btc etf probably tomorrow). 

afterward (mid 2024), ethereum will take the stage in a big way.

i base this on the fact that many eth l2s are close to completing legendary technical scaling and interoperable achievements. 

additionally, ethereum is the most likely to receive institutional interest after bitcoin for following etf approval. 

i'm unbothered by unaligned l1s that have shot their shot early. the bull run has just started, and the most important parts have yet to come (they know it'll be hard to compete once ethereum defi summer returns).

so, who will rally the hardest shortly and during the heat of 2024? 

imo, those most closely aligned and solving problems for ethereum (especially those designed to grow with ethereum or polygon). 

l2s (#polygon), defi (quickswap dragonfi 2.0), depin, interoperability, data availability, gaming, & oracles will all easily receive much interest. 

the recovery will come to those with the most potent narrative, but actual adoption and shipping will matter much more than past bull runs. 

things are getting serious due to the institutional aspect and coming regulation.

solana 🤝 ethereum

their aim to bridge solana and ethereum is monumental. with communities converging across chains, this project stands as a unifying force in the space.

unique art

they've adopted a cool pixel art style that blends punk vibes with awesome digital portraits, making them stand out with clean aesthetics. it's a nod to inclusivity.

defying the narrative

in the face of ""nfts are dead"" headlines, crypto undeads emerges as a rebuttal, branding themselves ""crypto undeads"" – kind of catchy, right? 
it's a testament to blockchain resilience, a narrative that resonates across the entire space.

clear vision

@knownasdollar , one of the most respected and well-connected individuals in the punks community, set out with a vision—to forge one of solana's most robust ips. he wants the project to be the long-term hold for collectors on solana, just like punks are on ethereum.

big hype & cool collabs

the collaborations are staggering. partnerships with @cyberkongz, @kaijukingz, @claynosaurz, @piratenation, @assetdash, and @chimpersnft signal an embrace of diverse communities, stirring up unparalleled excitement.

fair & open for everyone

they're meticulously handpicking allocations to prevent bots from taking over, ensuring equal shares for solana and ethereum communities and making sure everyone gets a fair chance.

as the countdown ticks away, anticipation grows for the momentous event on january 11, 2024. save the date, as the degenx journey is gearing up for its next exciting phase. the community's participation and support have been instrumental in this incredible ride, and the team expresses gratitude to all who have contributed to the project's success.

on the surface, it's beautiful art, but on a deeper level it represents an important transition that is about to happen in ordinals.

why do i think that? it's both a recursive and cursed collection.

recursive inscriptions were an incredibly innovative feature added to the ordinals protocol, allowing you to reference data from other ordinals last year.

i expect recursiveness to grow in popularity, as it is a much cheaper inscription option and enables a new level of composability between ordinals that wasn't previously possible. i predict we will see an explosion in recursive pfp collections, as much as we will see an explosion in recursive gen art collection.

why do i think this particular collection warrants to be the ""grail"" of recursive collections? just look at it. the art itself is recursive, and what better to express this recursiveness by using the most popular proportion in nature - the golden ratio.",2024-01-07 21:42:00,False,138,28,15,2024,ETH,positive,0.6565005,0.043698415,0.29980105

4980,11663,Mr F,"why ethereum maxis should love solana

a longpost rant by mr f, proposer of the first block of eth2 and solidity developer since 2018

- philosophy of decentralization
whether or not you like solana personally, it is the first majorly successful smart contract network that isn't a clone of the ethereum virtual machine. (evm)
this is fantastic for the general ideology of cryptocurrency and decentralization.

other l1s like polygon, binance smart chain, and even tron are based on the evm, as are all ethereum layer 2s. (that i know of)
if there is a fatal flaw in the evm, solana is unaffected.

competition means pressure on the ethereum ecosystem and developers to do better or be left behind.
if you want ethereum to improve, you should want solana to be good competition.

- cost
solana is extremely cheap to use, and this is great for users.
it seems like a clear advantage at the surface level, but i think many don't understand 𝑤ℎ𝑦 ethereum is so expensive.
expensive = bad, ethereum sucks. but this is not the truth.

despite what you might read on ct, high costs are caused by an extreme level of demand.
ethereum is expensive 𝑏𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒 it is good, otherwise nobody would use it and transactions would be cheap.
""nobody drives in new york, there's too much traffic!""

scaling is being worked on, but for now you are pretty much choosing between cost and security.

- decentralization
i need to preface this that i'm not an expert on validators or network security.
ethereum and solana validators work differently, and one is not exactly comparable to the other.
hardware requirements for solana validators are extremely high, but as there's no sol requirement it might still be more accessible to an average person than acquiring 32 eth.
(not counting things like rpl and lido since this is about adding network security with individual validators)

with that said, there are only 1,951 solana validators at the time of writing, versus 902,167 for ethereum.
this difference in level of centralization and security should be shocking to someone who assumed they are more or less the same.

you might say hey, most of those ethereum validators are probably owned by a few large groups.
maybe this is true... but can't the same be said about solana with its much lower figure?
while we can't know for sure, i feel confident saying there are probably many more individuals like myself who only have one ethereum validator, just running it for the good of the network, than there are solana validators in total.

yes, ethereum has problems and could be more decentralized, but it's still not even in the same ballpark - ethereum is far more secure.

- so is this just bait?
no, despite the current difference in level of centralization, solana can improve.
optimizations, hardware advancements, or even just greater adoption (more validators) could all help solana become less centralized and more secure.
despite being ""more"" secure on paper, ethereum still has a chance of encountering fatal flaws that solana doesn't have.

- solana development issues
i'm working on a game for solana, and while i'm not greatest developer, i think most will find the learning experience challenging.
it's completely foreign for an ethereum veteran, all basic functionalities are completely different and rust is a more difficult language to understand.
documentation quality is poor, frequently outdated or just non-existent, and libraries are lacking.
at the moment most creators are just using the default token programs for shitcoins and nfts, there's a lack of experimentation and innovation.

on the other hand, solana has a large and growing base of loyal users, which means there is money on the table and developers will crawl through the mud for it eventually.
and, ethereum faced all of the same problems when it was newer and still growing.
if solana is here to stay, these things will improve.

- smart contract culture (""programs"" on solana)
this one is probably the largest problem for me, and has two distinct issues.
first, solana programs are upgradeable by default. they can be made immutable, but nobody cares.
so? anything can be rugged by a rogue developer.

second, program verification (like smart contract verification on etherscan) is disregarded.
if the program can be upgraded at any point, it doesn't really matter, but both immutability and program verification are needed for security.
verified source also helps new developers learn difficult techniques and build from them instead of reinventing the wheel.

on the other side of this, i hope that with the recent acquisition of solscan by etherscan will lead to growth in both of these areas.
otherwise, i fear the change will only occur after it becomes enough of a problem.
it's a bit like ""safety regulations are written in blood"".

[ note: i started drafting this a few days ago, and since then mango farm rugged... ]

- conclusion
ethereum is far more secure than solana, and safer for large amounts of money or long term nfts.
however, it is now too expensive for most users and developers due to high demand.

layer 2s are accessible, but very fragmented.
other evm l1s like polygon and bsc feel like l2s, copies of ethereum, but they don't share the security of ethereum.
l2s like optimism and arbitrum supposedly do, but tend to have other risks like centralized sequencers.
they aren't diverse enough from ethereum to offer anything new, and i don't feel confident many of them will still exist in 10 years.

solana offers more value to cryptocurrency than most of those because it isn't based on the evm, and it's cheap and fast.
but it's very centralized compared to ethereum, and there are severe issues with the culture of upgradeable programs (contracts) and source code verification.
only a strong push from the entire solana community can change this culture.

ethereum developers and users should use their years of experience to help with these problems, for the benefit of both networks.

i plan to contribute with:
- ""eth developers guide to solana"" thread
- advanced game project with verified source + immutable deployment

as the chain grows, there are sure to be imposters, scammers, and fakes so bookmark this page.

solana 🤝 ethereum

their aim to bridge solana and ethereum is monumental. with communities converging across chains, this project stands as a unifying force in the space.

unique art

they've adopted a cool pixel art style that blends punk vibes with awesome digital portraits, making them stand out with clean aesthetics. it's a nod to inclusivity.

defying the narrative

in the face of ""nfts are dead"" headlines, crypto undeads emerges as a rebuttal, branding themselves ""crypto undeads"" – kind of catchy, right? 
it's a testament to blockchain resilience, a narrative that resonates across the entire space.

clear vision

@knownasdollar , one of the most respected and well-connected individuals in the punks community, set out with a vision—to forge one of solana's most robust ips. he wants the project to be the long-term hold for collectors on solana, just like punks are on ethereum.

big hype & cool collabs

the collaborations are staggering. partnerships with @cyberkongz, @kaijukingz, @claynosaurz, @piratenation, @assetdash, and @chimpersnft signal an embrace of diverse communities, stirring up unparalleled excitement.

fair & open for everyone

they're meticulously handpicking allocations to prevent bots from taking over, ensuring equal shares for solana and ethereum communities and making sure everyone gets a fair chance.

a countdown is running in the telegram chat, marking the imminent opening of the bridge to the ethereum blockchain in just 4 days. 
this technological marvel is set to seamlessly connect dgnx on #avax and #ethereum, with future plans to expand beyond.

the significance of this bridge is paramount as it ensures a smooth and interconnected experience for $dgnx trading pairs on both avax and eth blockchains. this move enhances liquidity and accessibility for the community, fostering a more dynamic ecosystem.

one noteworthy aspect is the commitment to maintaining a capped maximum token supply of 21,000,000. this strategic decision is designed to uphold the project's integrity and aligns with sound economic principles in the decentralized finance (defi) space.

as the countdown ticks away, anticipation grows for the momentous event on january 11, 2024. save the date, as the degenx journey is gearing up for its next exciting phase. the community's participation and support have been instrumental in this incredible ride, and the team expresses gratitude to all who have contributed to the project's success.

get ready for a groundbreaking development that not only strengthens the $dgnx ecosystem but also marks a significant milestone in the broader landscape of decentralized finance. your presence and involvement make this journey all the more remarkable. buckle up for an adventure into the future of decentralized finance with #degenx ecosystem!

on the surface, it's beautiful art, but on a deeper level it represents an important transition that is about to happen in ordinals.

why do i think that? it's both a recursive and cursed collection.

recursive inscriptions were an incredibly innovative feature added to the ordinals protocol, allowing you to reference data from other ordinals last year.

i expect recursiveness to grow in popularity, as it is a much cheaper inscription option and enables a new level of composability between ordinals that wasn't previously possible. i predict we will see an explosion in recursive pfp collections, as much as we will see an explosion in recursive gen art collection.

why do i think this particular collection warrants to be the ""grail"" of recursive collections? just look at it. the art itself is recursive, and what better to express this recursiveness by using the most popular proportion in nature - the golden ratio.",2024-01-07 21:42:00,False,138,28,15,2024,ETH,positive,0.6565005,0.043698415,0.29980105

5102,11794,Mr F,"why ethereum maxis should love solana

a longpost rant by mr f, proposer of the first block of eth2 and solidity developer since 2018

- philosophy of decentralization
whether or not you like solana personally, it is the first majorly successful smart contract network that isn't a clone of the ethereum virtual machine. (evm)
this is fantastic for the general ideology of cryptocurrency and decentralization.

other l1s like polygon, binance smart chain, and even tron are based on the evm, as are all ethereum layer 2s. (that i know of)
if there is a fatal flaw in the evm, solana is unaffected.

competition means pressure on the ethereum ecosystem and developers to do better or be left behind.
if you want ethereum to improve, you should want solana to be good competition.

- cost
solana is extremely cheap to use, and this is great for users.
it seems like a clear advantage at the surface level, but i think many don't understand 𝑤ℎ𝑦 ethereum is so expensive.
expensive = bad, ethereum sucks. but this is not the truth.

despite what you might read on ct, high costs are caused by an extreme level of demand.
ethereum is expensive 𝑏𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒 it is good, otherwise nobody would use it and transactions would be cheap.
""nobody drives in new york, there's too much traffic!""

scaling is being worked on, but for now you are pretty much choosing between cost and security.

- decentralization
i need to preface this that i'm not an expert on validators or network security.
ethereum and solana validators work differently, and one is not exactly comparable to the other.
hardware requirements for solana validators are extremely high, but as there's no sol requirement it might still be more accessible to an average person than acquiring 32 eth.
(not counting things like rpl and lido since this is about adding network security with individual validators)

with that said, there are only 1,951 solana validators at the time of writing, versus 902,167 for ethereum.
this difference in level of centralization and security should be shocking to someone who assumed they are more or less the same.

you might say hey, most of those ethereum validators are probably owned by a few large groups.
maybe this is true... but can't the same be said about solana with its much lower figure?
while we can't know for sure, i feel confident saying there are probably many more individuals like myself who only have one ethereum validator, just running it for the good of the network, than there are solana validators in total.

yes, ethereum has problems and could be more decentralized, but it's still not even in the same ballpark - ethereum is far more secure.

- so is this just bait?
no, despite the current difference in level of centralization, solana can improve.
optimizations, hardware advancements, or even just greater adoption (more validators) could all help solana become less centralized and more secure.
despite being ""more"" secure on paper, ethereum still has a chance of encountering fatal flaws that solana doesn't have.

- solana development issues
i'm working on a game for solana, and while i'm not greatest developer, i think most will find the learning experience challenging.
it's completely foreign for an ethereum veteran, all basic functionalities are completely different and rust is a more difficult language to understand.
documentation quality is poor, frequently outdated or just non-existent, and libraries are lacking.
at the moment most creators are just using the default token programs for shitcoins and nfts, there's a lack of experimentation and innovation.

on the other hand, solana has a large and growing base of loyal users, which means there is money on the table and developers will crawl through the mud for it eventually.
and, ethereum faced all of the same problems when it was newer and still growing.
if solana is here to stay, these things will improve.

- smart contract culture (""programs"" on solana)
this one is probably the largest problem for me, and has two distinct issues.
first, solana programs are upgradeable by default. they can be made immutable, but nobody cares.
so? anything can be rugged by a rogue developer.

second, program verification (like smart contract verification on etherscan) is disregarded.
if the program can be upgraded at any point, it doesn't really matter, but both immutability and program verification are needed for security.
verified source also helps new developers learn difficult techniques and build from them instead of reinventing the wheel.

on the other side of this, i hope that with the recent acquisition of solscan by etherscan will lead to growth in both of these areas.
otherwise, i fear the change will only occur after it becomes enough of a problem.
it's a bit like ""safety regulations are written in blood"".

[ note: i started drafting this a few days ago, and since then mango farm rugged... ]

- conclusion
ethereum is far more secure than solana, and safer for large amounts of money or long term nfts.
however, it is now too expensive for most users and developers due to high demand.

layer 2s are accessible, but very fragmented.
other evm l1s like polygon and bsc feel like l2s, copies of ethereum, but they don't share the security of ethereum.
l2s like optimism and arbitrum supposedly do, but tend to have other risks like centralized sequencers.
they aren't diverse enough from ethereum to offer anything new, and i don't feel confident many of them will still exist in 10 years.

solana offers more value to cryptocurrency than most of those because it isn't based on the evm, and it's cheap and fast.
but it's very centralized compared to ethereum, and there are severe issues with the culture of upgradeable programs (contracts) and source code verification.
only a strong push from the entire solana community can change this culture.

ethereum developers and users should use their years of experience to help with these problems, for the benefit of both networks.

i plan to contribute with:
- ""eth developers guide to solana"" thread
- advanced game project with verified source + immutable deployment

5132,11825,Péter Szilágyi (karalabe.eth),"i realised that the 1559 burn is my absolute favourite mechanism in the #ethereum evm. it is the great equaliser.

before 1559, miners had the privilege of tweaking gas limits and prices of transactions mined by themselves arbitrarily. sure, they always carried an opportunity cost of doing so, but it was capability imbalance vs. normies. this made it extremely hard to gamify stuff.

with the 1559 burn, it doesn't matter if you're a normie or a miner, the burn will hit you exactly the same way: it goes up for everyone, it comes down for everyone, it burns into everyone.

this is amazing, because it's a mechanism that you can build gamification on top, that miners cannot evade.

for sure, miners will always have special opportunities. they can decide at the point of block production to transact or not vs. normies who have to publish their tx and cannot retract it. but the burn gives an anchor point for dapps to play with that is uniform across everyone.

now, of course, the goal of the 1559 burn was meant to be a fee stability mechanism that dapps are unaware of... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ...for me it's one of the best mechanisms for my toy dapps to *be* aware of.",2024-01-16 09:08:00,False,404,51,21,2024,ETH,positive,0.7768393,0.031012999,0.19214772

before 1559, miners had the privilege of tweaking gas limits and prices of transactions mined by themselves arbitrarily. sure, they always carried an opportunity cost of doing so, but it was capability imbalance vs. normies. this made it extremely hard to gamify stuff.

with the 1559 burn, it doesn't matter if you're a normie or a miner, the burn will hit you exactly the same way: it goes up for everyone, it comes down for everyone, it burns into everyone.

this is amazing, because it's a mechanism that you can build gamification on top, that miners cannot evade.

for sure, miners will always have special opportunities. they can decide at the point of block production to transact or not vs. normies who have to publish their tx and cannot retract it. but the burn gives an anchor point for dapps to play with that is uniform across everyone.

now, of course, the goal of the 1559 burn was meant to be a fee stability mechanism that dapps are unaware of... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ...for me it's one of the best mechanisms for my toy dapps to *be* aware of.",2024-01-16 09:08:00,False,404,51,21,2024,ETH,positive,0.7768393,0.031012999,0.19214772

ℹ️ about blast

blast is a new ethereum layer 2 blockchain and the first l2 offering native yield for eth and stablecoins along with faster and cheaper transactions for users. blast is backed by paradigm, standard crypto, and egirl capital.

🔮 random numbers and price feeds—all #poweredbypyth

a new l2 with native yield could unlock a new decentralized economy, driven by defi—perpetual trading, lending, and dexs—as well as nfts and socialfi: these verticals would depend on a secure, reliable, and low-latency source of financial data and randomness.

this partnership recognizes pyth network as the preferred oracle partner of the blast ecosystem. pyth entropy is designed to be the fastest source of decentralized randomness, and as such, is positioned to power the blast layer 2 economy and support its nft ecosystem.

pyth entropy's integration into the blast ecosystem will enhance its capabilities for supporting a multitude of web3 verticals, such as nft initiatives, prediction markets, and socialfi. a random number solution can dictate outcomes for creative initiatives such as nft creation and distribution, predictive markets and betting, and web3 gaming.

pyth price feeds are the lowest-latency and most available price feeds for smart contract developers, covering over 400 real-time data feeds across five major asset classes. access to high-resolution and wide-ranging price data is paramount for building sophisticated defi primitives.

🗣 quotes

“we’re proud to partner with pyth network, an oracle for financial market data, and now, on-chain random numbers,” said @pacmanblur, core contributor at blast. “pyth data will allow us to leverage the full potential of blast’s native yield and rewards system, and enable users and developers to use and build cutting-edge web3-native services on blast.”

""we're excited to have pyth price feeds and pyth entropy integrated on blast's fast, secure, and innovative layer 2 platform,” said marc tillement, director at the pyth data association. “with real-time market data and reliable random number generation, blast users will benefit from enhanced defi experiences.”",2024-01-16 18:39:00,False,516,79,30,2024,BTC,positive,0.7258315,0.0059752655,0.26819327

5302,12002,Labrys,"yes, you really can lose all your eth if you stake with geth

this article is not an attack on geth. i have the utmost respect for their team. unfortunately, through no fault of the @go_ethereum team because of how widely used geth is we need to have honest conversations about the risks of running geth when it holds a supermajority of stake.

this week the @ethereum network witnessed another one of its execution clients, @nethermindeth, experience a bug that took all validators running nethermind (~10% of the network) offline. this was a minor event because nethermind is run by a minority of stakers.

the above is a graph of the total balance of one of my own validators that runs nethermind. you can see that around 4am local time, the validator went offline when the bug first took place. the team released a patch ~4 hours later and by the time i installed it, the validator was back up and running around 9am local time. during this time, my validator was penalised at the same rate as what it earned rewards at. by 1pm on the same day, the validator balance was higher than it was before the outage. overall a very minor inconvenience.

many incorrectly assume that when running geth, if a similar bug were to occur, the penalty would be similar. this is not true. this has nothing to do with geth or the way geth has been built but everything to do with how many people are running geth.

according to https://t.co/iz68ftk7wl ~84% of all validators on ethereum are running geth. now in these staker’s defence, geth is unarguably the best and most stable client. whilst minority clients, like nethermind this week, have been plagued with bugs and downtime, geth has run faultlessly since the merge (and long before). in my own experience, i have found higher resource requirements and more missed attestations on my validators when switching from geth to a minority client.

nobody wants to move away from geth if they know they are more likely to experience more missed attestations and more downtime, especially those whose business model depends on uptime to advertise the highest yield, such as professional staking operators.

as of september last year, it is estimated that @lidofinance, the largest stake operator, runs ~76% of their validators on geth.

but i’m glad i’m running a minority client, even if i’m losing a few extra rewards here and there, not because i’m altruistic and am sacrificing a personal gain for the good of the decentralisation of the network, but because i know that my precious eth is safe from a supermajority bug.

5315,12016,Richard Heart,"#ethereum & #pulsechain tips. if you're running a node, geth is 4k i/o bound, so get a transcend t700 or samsung 990 pro, depending on if you have pci-e or pcie-4. if erigon then single core bound. thus 14900k is boss. 7950x3d will use the non 3d cores for higher boost, thus 14900k>7950x>7950x3d>anything else. more cpu cores, such as threadripper or other high core count cpus will lose as they have lower boost speed.

my guess, 14900k will beat 7950x3d by 10-14%. these things only apply to syncing. once you're sync'd it's a whole new ball game. syncing a geth archive node takes weeks. erigon is faster, but still takes forever.

ddr5 doesn't like 4 sticks at all, it likes 2 sticks. erigon and geth seem to use like 70 and 90 gb of ram, so probably 64gig at double the speed might run faster than 128gb at half the speed. *yeah ddr5 sucks like that. ddr5 might not suck the same on servers or threadrippers with 2x or 4x the memory channels.

overclocking hardware running software that might be used for finance ain't smart. ecc ram is good if you can run it.

finally, if your cpu is truly pitiful you might be cpu bound instead of 4k i/o bound on geth.

finally. proof of stake finality likely invalidates much of the security theater of building a whole chain from genesis, as you could just consider the last 15 minutes finality genesis. then you can validate with just the last final checkpoint that's 15 minutes old instead of downloading and running 10 years of transactions. :)

5321,12022,Cardano YOD₳,"the dominant client in the cardano network comes from the iog team.

if #cardano is to be more resilient to bugs in the source code, there must be more clients that will be built by independent teams.

in all major networks, including #bitcoin and #ethereum, the version of the client that comes from the oldest (original) team is dominant.

it makes sense since this team designed the protocol and set up things like monetary policy, reward mechanism, etc. 

this client is the most time-tested.

volunteers install the client on their nodes. the network is gradually becoming more distributed and decentralized.

nodes producing new blocks are more important than user nodes that do not produce blocks.

it is not only the number of nodes in the network that is important but also the decentralization. 

decentralization is a decisive factor regarding nodes that are important for the network.

there may be thousands of nodes in the network, but the ones that produce the blocks are critical to the functioning of the network. 

for example, with bitcoin, it is only 10 nodes (pools).

if the operation of the network is dependent on a single client implementation, the risk of failure is relatively high.

see figure 1.

a distributed network can be resilient to the failure of a node (or multiple nodes). 

however, the network is not immune to a bug in the source code. a bug can cause all nodes to crash at the same time.

the network can somehow deal with the node crash itself. but it may happen that the crash will require fixing the bug and restarting the network.

a preventive measure against network failure is client diversity. 

there must be more clients that will be implemented by other independent teams.

different clients must be compatible with each other. 

this means that they will work exactly the same in terms of communication protocol and network rules.

the original team (in cardano's case it's iog) must make the formal specification of the protocol available.

see figure 2.

formal specifications are crucial because they provide an unambiguous description of how a protocol should function.

this includes details about the protocol's behavior, its expected inputs and outputs, and the sequence of operations it should perform.

it provides a reference point that can guide the development process and help ensure that the client is implemented correctly.

not only the existence of alternative client implementations is important, but also their adoption by operators.

ideally, the representation of individual clients in the network would be as proportional as possible. 

so if there are 4 client implementations, each client would have 25% representation in the network.

see figure 3.

if there was a fatal failure of one client implementation, only 25% of the nodes in the network would be affected.

the remaining nodes with a different version of the client, i.e. 75% of the nodes in the network, would continue to work.

see figure 4.

the diversity of clients, perhaps a little surprisingly for some, increases the decentralization of the network.

having multiple teams ensures that no single team has undue influence over the network’s development or direction. 

this aligns with the principle of decentralization, which aims to prevent any single entity from having too much control.

in the cardano ecosystem, several teams plan to build an alternative cardano client.

the team building the typescript implementation is probably the furthest along. 

their version is still far from becoming a full-fledged client, but it handles basic operations such as fetching blocks and syncing the chain.

building an alternative client is complex and expensive. 

additionally, iog regularly deploys upgrades. this adds new functionality.

all existing clients will need to keep up with the client from the iog team in the future. 

in practice, this means implementing all upgrades.

having more clients on the network also means being more vigilant about network upgrades. 

network upgrades are currently handled by the hard-fork combinator.

a wider diversity of clients can complicate this process.

teams building alternative cardano clients should be an integral part of the ecosystem, including funding for which $ada coins from the project treasury should very likely be used.

this is a challenge for the community. 

decentralization is the responsibility of the community, so it should ensure that cardano is decentralized at the client level.

if blockchain networks are to become the financial backbone of the world, it is necessary to ensure their 100% reliability. 

this is currently not guaranteed.

the cardano community should think about what steps lead to a higher diversity of clients.

especially recently, we’ve seen a wave of interest in incentivizing solo stakers—some of the most competent and mission driven operators in the industry, to participate in new networks and extensions of core ethereum staking. 

but the problem is that these folks are not easy to identify onchain. the list we have curated solves for this. 

based on state of the art ml work and a lot of hardening over the past 7mos by putting it through the ringer with different partners, we are very confident in the degree of signal it carries—especially in filtering out whitelabeled solos.

we think this can be a powerful tool in adding sybil resistance to curated sets, as well as in airdrops that might want to target solo stakers.

today we are releasing the first version of the list, which covers indices 1 to 500,000.  over time we will be releasing refreshes bringing it closer to the present.

head on over to the repo below to start working with it. we’re excited to see what folks conjure up with it.

5338,12039,John E Deaton,"if people haven’t figured it out by now, let me help you: the speech was a pure money grab - nothing more, nothing less. 

whether you believe in #eth or whether ethereum is a great technology or ecosystem, is not the point. as i’ve said before, had the @secgov sued @ethereum @consensys @ethereumjoseph & @vitalikbuterin, alleging #eth was a security, instead of @ripple @bgarlinghouse & @chrislarsensf, i would’ve sued the sec just like i did over #xrp.  

prior to the speech being given, the sec 💯 refused to discuss any particular crypto token. since the speech, the sec has 💯 refused to discuss any particular crypto token, including #eth. why hasn’t there been an investigation? here’s an explanation:

history books will discuss this era as the corruption era. an era when congress exempts itself from insider trading laws so that members of congress, recently briefed about a pandemic and a government shutdown, can use that non-public information and cash out of the stock market before it crashes, making hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

an era when the speaker of the house presents a bill on the house floor favoring credit cards companies, like visa, and then shortly thereafter, the speaker and her husband are offered millions in pre-ipo shares of visa, not offered to the public, making millions of dollars. 

an era when the vice president of the united states uses his office and position to secure millions of dollars for his son and his family, but deny it to the american people when running for president. 

an era when the president of the united states has foreign governments and foreign nationals intentionally staying at his resorts and hotels, making sure he knows it, in the hopes of securing favors in the future. 

an era when the secretary of state has a foundation that accepts donations and money from foreign countries and foreign nationals while she is secretary of state, and meeting those donors in her official capacity for the united states. 

an era when the chairman of the fda literally leaves his government post and shortly thereafter is named on board of pfizer. 

the same era that the son-in-law of the president gets a loan for hundreds of millions of dollars from apollo group and shortly thereafter, the sec chair drops an investigation into apollo group, and then afterwords, that same sec chairman resigns from the sec, but is immediately appointed as an advisor or board member to apollo group. 

an era so ripe with corruption, the ceo of an offshore exchange, and the son of democratic operatives, donates tens of millions of dollars to the incumbent administration for the purposes of access to regulators, and after those donations, he gets private meetings with the chairman of the sec, the chairman of the cftc, and members of congress. 

because this era is marked with such a blatant disregard for conflicts of interests or appearances of improprieties, a director of corporation finance wouldn’t hesitate to give a speech providing a massive regulatory advantage for the same people literally paying him. he wouldn’t hesitate to allow those same people to help write the speech. nor would he hesitate to go work for those same folks after giving the speech. 

and because this speech occurred during the corruption era, msm and others, don’t bat an eye. 

why would they? it’s the corruption era. it’s expected. it’s the era of “get yours, while you can.”",2024-01-23 00:44:00,False,2711,884,177,2024,BTC,neutral,0.05024085,0.4713111,0.47844806

5341,12042,StygianOne,"when i was looking at older tweets from mkay, he is talking about that #saitachain #blockchain will be evm compatible.

what does it mean? lets see google result:

interoperability: 
dapps and smart contracts built for one evm-compatible protocol, such as ethereum, can  easily be moved to other evm-compatible chains with little code modifications.

faster learning curve: 
evm-compatible chains use solidity – ethereum's programming language.

what does it mean in simple way?

eth smart contracts can be used on #saitachain maybe with some little modification (or with no modification at all).

so if any #crypto dev wants to go into saitachain blockchain. they can use their own eth smart contracts or dapps.

majority of contracts is written in solidity.

the launch of seneca on the #ethereum mainnet is approaching, marking a significant milestone for both the protocol and its users.

restaking yield? it's all yours. pay fees only on what you borrow.

restaking has become one of the most established defi narratives at the beginning of 2024. recognizing this growing demand, seneca enables users to collateralize their liquid restaking tokens while still earning yield.

this means that you can now leverage your assets without sacrificing potential rewards or missing out on exciting airdrops.

when you borrow $senusd against #lrts, you not only have borrowing power but also retain full ownership of your yield.

5546,12262,Zoomer Oracle,"so some observations the last few weeks on bitcoin ordinals:

- less people dump it for quick profits unlike memecoins (current attention)

- more than 2x more volume than ethereum nfts

- fundamentally, nfts on bitcoin ironically make more sense than ethereum as all eth nfts are jpegs stored on aws. if it’s not stored onchain, do you really own the nft?

- an ordinal is stored in the witness data of a block and tied to a utxo so it is stored in every single bitcoin node. so no censorship.

- i can understand that some will be like “ok who cares about tech bro”. it indicates that ordinals make more sense as nfts and as we all meme’d bitcoin as a “gold store of value” , i don’t see how nfts don’t fit that narrative as well on that same “store of value” chain.

- bitcoin maxis are rich and hate them (you long everything bitcoin maxis hate fyi)

- we will get a huge nft bubble again but nfts have a skem reputation among normies (see celebs shill crap in 2021). ordinals is a new concept.

- btc ecosystem will increase because of new upcoming infra: more airdrops will be done to og collections.

all in all, i genuinely had a lot of fun trying to explore the ordinal ecosystem (which is a very big bullcase for normies when we get blowoff top in 2025). im 100% convinced it’s just the beginning. been doing a lot of research on it and it feels “early days” ‘esque.",2024-02-05 23:46:00,False,210,47,42,2024,BTC,neutral,0.40833542,0.110087305,0.48157728

https://t.co/l1ae8j6w1g

ethereum is going through the ""puberty phase"" of the rollup-centric roadmap. the rapid l2 scalability growth spurt has led to awkward fragmentation of composability, with a significant breakdown of network effects. l2s today are silos delineated by their sequencers, at bridging distance from each other as well as the l1.

thankfully this fragmented state of affairs is temporary—we can do better than slow and asynchronous bridges. with shared sequencing plus real-time settlement we can (re)establish universal synchronous composability and (re)activate ethereum's network effects with maximum thrust. shared sequencing combines strengths of the modular and the monolithic theses.

we know ethereum l1 as a data availability layer. few realise ethereum l1 can also provide shared sequencing for rollups, with preconfirmations. there's a simple design with no hard fork required. such an ethereum shared sequencer would be maximally secure and credibly neutral, and would enjoy a half-trillion dollar tvl head start. ethereum l1 as the canonical shared sequencer—isn't that a compelling and unifying schelling point? :)",2024-02-05 17:15:00,False,633,109,44,2024,ETH,positive,0.620065,0.066555426,0.3133796

5601,12319,Richard Heart,"#ethereum i'm here to protect you from scams again. scammers want to trick you into sending to their scam addresses. here's one you might not have seen yet.

1. create a new address with the same starting and ending characters as a real address that you've sent to.
2. make a fake transaction so that etherscan shows as thought you actually sent to their fake address before. they copy the last send's value, and name of token (but it's a fake token, so usually grayed out with no logo showing in etherscan.)
3. do this to lots of addresses and wait for people to fall for it.

why does this trick work? because people trust what etherscan showed them, instead of using their own history stored locally. because they didn't use a test transaction and confirm with the other party, or yourself, whatever might see the real balance of the real token at the real address. because showing just the starting and ending characters of an address is basically harmful if scammers can just create addresses of their own with the same start and end and only the middle characters are different.

this is where devs can do better, by showing the start, end and middle. basically, the idea of ""fingerprint."" being used to make more human identifiable one long string from a different long string has been around a long time. for example, when you click the lock certificate and inspect an ssl security certificate. a simple fix would be to show some middle characters for now as well.",2024-02-05 18:03:00,False,1994,497,77,2024,ETH,negative,0.08528755,0.47955078,0.43516165

🌟 we are thrilled to announce the launch of our newest meme token - lion, the king of memes! 

🦁 lion token will run on 2 chains:
1. ethereum mainnet
2. athene mainnet

starting next month (march), alongside the monthly gem to ath conversion, athene miners will receive additional leon tokens at a fantastic rate of 1 gem = 1 lion to express gratitude to our network.

for example:
📆 early in march:
#gem to #ath conversion rate: 1 gem = 0.003 ath
you have 54,000 gem
👉 so, you'll get:
54,000 x 0.003 = 163 ath
plus an extra 54,000 lion tokens! 

📌 note:
lion tokens will be listed in https://t.co/df37k96cyq and mexc in march 2024.
and other exchanges in q2/2024.
you will receive both ath and lion tokens every month.

stay tuned for further updates! 🚀

for example, we are adding bls support to plutus v3 alongside the hydra and mithril projects that provide rich business and technical requirements for cardano to evolve. ethereum has a vibrant ecosystem of l2s that are well-represented in the roadmap for ethereum's core protocol. 

bitcoin will not change or add any additional functionality. this means everything is insanely hard to do with bitcoin l2s and usually requires centralized or federated infrastructure to operate.

5630,12348,Richard Heart,"#ethereum i'm here to protect you from scams again. scammers want to trick you into sending to their scam addresses. here's one you might not have seen yet.

1. create a new address with the same starting and ending characters as a real address that you've sent to.
2. make a fake transaction so that etherscan shows as thought you actually sent to their fake address before. they copy the last send's value, and name of token (but it's a fake token, so usually grayed out with no logo showing in etherscan.)
3. do this to lots of addresses and wait for people to fall for it.

why does this trick work? because people trust what etherscan showed them, instead of using their own history stored locally. because they didn't use a test transaction and confirm with the other party, or yourself, whatever might see the real balance of the real token at the real address. because showing just the starting and ending characters of an address is basically harmful if scammers can just create addresses of their own with the same start and end and only the middle characters are different.

this is where devs can do better, by showing the start, end and middle. basically, the idea of ""fingerprint."" being used to make more human identifiable one long string from a different long string has been around a long time. for example, when you click the lock certificate and inspect an ssl security certificate. a simple fix would be to show some middle characters for now as well.",2024-02-05 18:03:00,False,1994,497,77,2024,ETH,negative,0.08528755,0.47955078,0.43516165

$17.5 per th/s should be a conservative upper bound. the s21 can be overclocked to reduce the dominant nominal rig cost of $14 per th/s. should bitmain itself deploy the hashrate the sticker price can be discounted by bitmain's profit margin. manufacturing billions of dollars of s21s will lead to economies of scale and better pricing from suppliers like tsmc as well as assemblers. manufacturing and installing state-of-the-art s21s is one of many strategies to deploy hashrate. for example, old hardware acquired at a significant discount can cover some of the hashrate, especially post-halving. datacenter costs can be partially recouped by reselling capacity at discount pricing, e.g. at $100k per mw to ai farms. rig costs can also be partially recouped by reselling psus and scrap metal.",2024-02-11 07:34:00,False,690,147,53,2024,BTC,neutral,0.15824084,0.13428338,0.7074758

2. ethereum is actually useful. it's not just a speculative asset, it's a platform that people are using to build decentralized applications.

+ seneca x #lrtfi (@eigenlayer)
+ pt (@pendle_fi) chambers: $eeth (@ether_fi) & $rseth (@kelpdao).

keep reading for all the details.

—————————————————

0% tax & ethereum liquidity seeding. 🏛️

initial $sen liquidity has been seeded on the ethereum mainnet. $sen is now available for trading on uniswap.

$sen trading tax has been removed. users can now transact $sen on both #arbitrum and #ethereum without incurring any fees, except for lp ones.

trade $sen on both chains. the staking module remains exclusive to #arbitrum.

buy $sen on ethereum: https://t.co/hbpwikz2tt

—————————————————

seneca bridge. 🏛️

thanks to the $sen and $senusd oft integration (@layerzero_labs), seneca can explore new markets and offer users an efficient method to collateralize high-yield defi assets across all major evm chains.

users are now able to bridge $sen and $senusd between #arbitrum and #ethereum, allowing for seamless movement between the two chains.

to check how to use the seneca bridge, you can refer to the tweet below:

🔗 https://t.co/78r3ybn6yh

—————————————————

ethereum $senusd liquidity. 🏛️

$senusd liquidity will be incentivized on the ethereum mainnet on @curvefinance.

borrow $senusd on #ethereum or bridge it from #arbitrum in order to provide liquidity and start earning $sen rewards.

concentrated liquidity pools and automated vaults are next on the list, so as to further strengthen and deepen the ethereum mainnet liquidity.

rewards are live.

provide liquidity for $senusd here: https://t.co/fmmyi2urnk

—————————————————

seneca x lrtfi. 🏛️

by deploying on the ethereum mainnet, seneca directly taps into one of the fastest-growing and highest-performing defi sectors: lrtfi.

upcoming apricus chambers on ethereum:

🏛 pt-eeth chamber (@ether_fi x @pendle_fi)
🏛 pt-rseth chamber (@kelpdao x @pendle_fi)

users will be able to borrow $senusd against the principal tokens (pts) of $eeth and $rseth.

this means adding a capital efficiency layer on top of one of the highest-performing defi sectors, all while seizing the fixed apy and extra yield powered by @pendle_fi.

seneca users retain full ownership of their yield: users only pay interest on the $senusd amount they borrow.

fold your position and leverage your #lrtfi yield, or simply borrow against your assets while keeping your guaranteed yield upon maturity.

oh wait it’s 2024 and cardano still doesn’t support native usdc forcing users who want access to the most trusted stablecoin to incur bridge risk or use one of the 15-20 other chains it’s natively available on. it’s a basic integration every smart contract chain with real developer and user adoption must have, to argue otherwise is to blindly ignore the data.

have you listened to the latest @iohk_charles interview with @cryptorecruitr? a @cardano_cf led discussion with circle dating back to 2021 has not materialized into anything meanwhile multiple foundations for other l1s a fraction the size of cardano have launched native usdc support on mainnet.

almost feels like we may have the wrong set of people leading these discussions if after this long there’s been no tangible progress. this is not what advocating for the best interest of cardano adoption and growth looks like at all.

for all the talk about “realfi” and having a meaningful positive impact on economic activity in the real world this is honestly a sad and embarrassing current state for the cardano ecosystem. this is not about decentralization or intersect or voltaire or other stablecoins on cardano. this is about giving cardano users the option to choose the stablecoin they prefer and empowering developers to build more competitive products by tapping into usdcs global liquidity layer as the most widely adopted and trusted stablecoin ever created.

if you have read up until this point it must mean you care about the future growth and adoption of cardano the same way we do, for this we say thank you. more importantly though if you do care please take this as a public call to action for the community to demand better from @cardano_cf and @inputoutputhk to get usdc integration completed. the best time to hold the founding entities more accountable for completing a task most other foundations complete in a few months timeline was in 2021 when the cf led discussions with circle started, the 2nd best time is now.",2024-02-09 16:52:00,False,327,75,46,2024,BTC,neutral,0.121691324,0.42844573,0.4498629

5837,12561,Cardano YOD₳,"according to messari's state of cardano q4 2023, we are growing in all relevant stats.

when you take other reports from messari and compare #cardano with projects like #ethereum, #avalanche, #algorand, and others, you realize that we have to work on adoption.

see the table.

avalanche, ripple (xrp ledger), algorand, and ethereum lead in the number of daily transactions.

#bitcoin, ethereum, and #solana lead in the number of active daily addresses.

in tvl, ethereum, solana, and avalanche lead.

it stands to reason that older ecosystems have a larger user base. 

cardano is still a young platform. the defi ecosystem is in its infancy, but it is developing dramatically.

the next bull run will be the first in which cardano will have a defi ecosystem. i expect the number of users to increase.

in terms of the number of users, all ecosystems are roughly similar - they have several tens of thousands of users. 

only ethereum has roughly a 10x lead. with solana, it may (or may not) be fake data.

the number of transactions is very high for some projects, especially avalanche and algorand. in the context of the number of users, they are far too high.

it is possible that in some use cases, a small number of users send a large number of transactions to each other.

it doesn't make sense with solana, as each user would have to make an average of about 200 transactions per day.

it is possible that messari does not distinguish between successful and failed transactions.

some ecosystems are ahead of cardano, but not too far. 

cardano needs new users and significant partnerships.

in response to recent revelations regarding the concentration of @ethereum nodes in centralized data centers, opsec reaffirms its commitment to decentralization. the findings, as outlined in a recent article, underscore the importance of addressing vulnerabilities associated with centralized hosting.

at opsec, we have long recognized the need for a decentralized solution to node hosting. our platform, cloudverse, has been developed with this imperative in mind. cloudverse simplifies the process of setting up nodes for ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, democratizing access to node infrastructure.

by offering a user-friendly interface and one-click node setup, cloudverse empowers individuals and organizations to participate in network validation and maintenance. this not only enhances accessibility but also reduces reliance on centralized entities, strengthening the decentralized fabric of blockchain networks.

the launch of cloudverse represents a proactive step towards mitigating the risks associated with centralized node hosting. by decentralizing node infrastructure, we aim to fortify the integrity and resilience of ethereum and other blockchain ecosystems.

as we continue to advance the principles of decentralization, opsec remains committed to collaboration and partnership within the blockchain community. we invite feedback and engagement from industry leaders and stakeholders as we collectively work towards a more decentralized future.

there was once such a bear whale in #bitcoin back about a decade ago. he trapped the price below $300 for many months. 

the slaying of the 🐻🐳 bear whale: https://t.co/7pyfjhlt4b

you can read about how invigorated the market became after slaying the bearwhale in this excerpt from @coindesk here: ""traders appear to have been reinvigorated by blood in the water this week in the aftermath of the slaying of the 'bearwhale' last monday. the bitcoin price was $327 at the start of last week and it was trading for $370 at the week's end, according to the coindesk bitcoin price index. after weeks of tepid trading volumes, bitcoin exchanges showed a surge in orders, hitting 642,000 btc on 9th october. this almost topped the 657,000 btc in total trading volume at the height of the buying activity as the massive sell order of 26,000 coins was unloaded by the so-called bearwhale on the market on sunday.""

you can read the bearwhale's signed message at this reddit link: https://t.co/vq6xbnpnio

this phase will easily pass for hex and if you think that, in this world filled with trillions of dollars of wealth, that hex isn't going to get bought up and go to dozens of dollars a token, you simply don't understand economics or where value is derived from.

if you believe that $14 million is what stands in the way between hex going to all time high's or dying off entirely, i have bad news for you. your understanding of markets is completely vapid and irrelevant.

this is a tremendous opportunity for a whole new class of hex users to gain a bigger portion of the pie that otherwise would take many months to accumulate and would likely result in much higher cost to them. 

it is also an opportunity for the community to come together and begin to chip away at the order book before fomo induces a rush of millions of dollars in bids onto the hex market.

5980,12705,Michaël van de Poppe,"#bitcoin on the edge of consolidation and rotation to ethereum & altseason is the play?

i'm always trying to allocate as much as possible towards segments that i find interesting. 

at this point, the strength in ethereum starts to pick up. why is that a good bet? let's discuss👇

first, the markets have been going through a tremendous run as bitcoin has accelerated from $25,000 to $53,000 in three months. in the meantime, other ecosystems have also been showing a ton of momentum, with the biggest winners being solana, injective protocol, and render protocol.

1⃣ - bitcoin's strength topping out -> rotation?

a few things should be considered when we're discussing this topic. 

strength topping out isn't a sign of a top bull market; it's just that, in short, the valuation of bitcoin is overpriced and needs to come back to reality, according to the markets. 

for instance, right now, the markets have been rushing up by 100% in one go, which usually isn't a trigger for a large group of investors to step into the markets, and they'd instead be waiting for a correction to happen.

the question is, how are you defining investors? well, in this case, it is not by the number of investors but by liquidity being interested in entering the markets. 

on the other hand, bitcoin's inflow is positive for the markets as the etf inflow shows additional interest from institutional parties to get into the markets. that's good. however, they are not the only ones in the markets, and they are not pushing the valuation of bitcoin on their own.

they are a significant variable, but not the only one. as a matter of fact, it's more likely that we'll be seeing organic corrections taking place and a longer cycle due to it. rotations happen based on macroeconomic events rather than crypto-native events, so things like cpi, fomc, gdp, and liquidity will be market-movers rather than fvg's. 

additionally, the halving event is going to have its impact. usually, there's a short-term peak before the halving, resulting in the standard 20-40% correction before the continuation of the market. 

close to that correction, that's where the sweet spot lies for rotation towards altcoins, and it seems we're seeing the first signals. 

2⃣ - #ethereum's strength -> dencun upgrade & potential spot etf

ethereum is getting underestimated by a mile. because the price hasn't been performing as it should in the past few years, it means that it will be doing the same in the coming period. works in all markets. 

compare it with the price action of bitcoin. i bet you that most people have been anticipating further declines when bitcoin was at $15k, while all the heavy news events were already priced in. the sentiment was different as emotions were taking an enormous toll.

the same is corresponding with ethereum. the dencun upgrade is around the corner, which will lower the transaction costs for layer 2's by 90%, making it accessible to be the settlement layer that we all wish it was. 

that's triggering a lot of momentum towards the ethereum network and combined with the potential spot etf approval, this can only bring fireworks. 

the valuation of ethereum as a whole needs to catch up as it should be at $3,800-4,200 if it's at the same stage as bitcoin's price currently. bitcoin will consolidate, and money will rotate towards ethereum.  

3⃣ - altseason -> what's the definition of this?

it's a loud and clear message. altseason. 

the term originates from 2017, when literally everything was going through the roof in a few months' time, and a rotation game happens through the markets where bitcoin moves first, then ethereum, then the rest.

however, that is still the case, but things are more complex. why is that? well, it's relatively simple. if you've invested in the solana ecosystem the past few months, you would have been in an alt season yourself. 

however, when investing in the ethereum ecosystem, you would have needed to catch up as most have been underperforming. therefore, the definition of alt season is relatively skewed and should be framed as something correlated to an ecosystem. 

in this aspect, we're facing an 'ethereum altseason'. 

4⃣ - #bitcoin dominance peaks pre-halving

history repeating itself, it seems very likely. 

in every cycle, the dominance of bitcoin has peaked prior to the halving. very understandable, as investors are rotating their profits from holding bitcoin towards other assets to generate a higher roi as there's no event that's going to push confidence within bitcoin at all.

on the other hand, projects are delaying their upgrades to after the bitcoin halving due to the same reasoning. 

and finally, investors need confidence to jump into the markets and bitcoin is the biggest asset for that. once that one has finalized its run, that will be the moment where the rotation towards other ecosystems takes place. 

in that aspect, we're on the edge of the same at this stage. 

we're going to be topping out with bitcoin relatively soon. a peak to $54-58k pre-halving and a harsh correction to $45-48k. 

that correction is going to be painful, but altcoins are going to feel less pain from that actual event as they are stronger in their btc pairs -> money rotating towards altcoins is basically that confirmation you're looking for.

recently, ethereum has shown more strength than bitcoin, and the entire ecosystem is on the edge of a breakout.

my gameplan is to take profits from bitcoin and rotate towards ethereum, but also ensure that i cover my position by increasing my usdt stack for a potential correction.

if that correction happens, maximize the allocation towards the ethereum ecosystem and some more.

it is also an opportunity for the community to come together and begin to chip away at the order book before fomo induces a rush of millions of dollars in bids onto the hex market.

6013,12738,Cardano YOD₳,"should we stop innovating because we have #bitcoin and #ethereum?

technological progress must continue because current technologies are objectively not advanced enough for mass adoption.

why?

the list of problems is long:

- expensive fees
- failed transaction
- low scalability
- declining decentralization
- every day a security incident in defi
- staking on ethereum requires third parties and banking licenses in some countries
- bitcoin and ethereum teams have given up on l1 scaling
- self-custody is complicated for people
- vitalik and his team have doubts about ethereum security
- integration with tradfi is complex
- high dependence on centralized infrastructure
- etc.

i am glad that innovation is taking place in all ecosystems.

but! 

the bitcoin team does not want to change bitcoin much. the pace of innovation is slow. many devs left the ecosystem.

the ethereum team chases the l2 scaling which seems risky. the pace of innovation is fast. things get often broken.

to say that the oldest projects will be around forever is a deliberate disregard of history.

first-mover advantage is not a guarantee of success in a young industry that has everything yet to come.

younger projects like cardano could learn from the mistakes of their predecessors. 

academic approach, peer review, and formal methods make sense for the newly built financial world. this is often ignored even though it is absolutely critical to success.

#cardano addresses many of the listed issues:

- fixed and predictable fees
- determinism
- plan to pay fees in tokens and stables
- high decentralization + on-chain governance
- plan to scale l1
- no defi hack yet
- both the iog team and the community trust the protocol
- parallelism

the crypto industry is not about one or two winners. it's not even about the three winners.

sooner or later, dominant projects will lose their market share and be replaced by a new one. it is natural and normal.

6164,12897,NftGen ♥️ $WELL,"ethereum nfts are currently experiencing a downturn. 

ordinals and the crypto market seems much more intriguing and profitable at the moment.

however, there are always exceptions.

i have an investment opportunity that has the potential to outperform them all🧵👇

as you all may know, yogapetz is soon launching its token. they have been working on it for years now, and you can't compare it with projects that are only launching tokens, because we are in the token meta right now.

$well has a purpose and real utilities with numerous big partners and the biggest vcs in the space backing them, like animoca brands and newman capital.

there is a farming campaign ongoing for about 2 months, and it seems like it’s slowly coming to an end.

continue reading for the real alpha 🌝

the farming is already a huge success, and the stats are insane👇

https://t.co/sror0szapg

why should you care, you may ask?

well, which exchange doesn’t want to list a token with such a user base and metrics?

and do you notice on which chain the farming campaign took place? connect the dots guys.

there are currently two nft projects that managed to get their token on binance: memeland and yugalabs.

if you held their nft pre-listing and held it through it, you would make a bag that potentially changed your life.

i don’t have to talk about the difficulty and sheer profits that a binance listing promises, and i’m not saying $well will launch there because i simply don’t know.

but if i connect all the dots and the data i have, it’s a possibility!

and if it should be true, yogapetz would be the biggest steal and most obvious play in the whole space right now!

here is the alpha:

in a recent announcement, there was a hint👇 (look at the end)

“season 2 coming soon.” now you might think that that’s just a farming extension.

i can relieve you; it’s not!

@keung hinted something🌝

thats extremely bullish in my opinion, and i will tell you why.

the simplified formula to get listed on a big cex. (case study memeland, portal)

-1 a successful farming campaign ✅
-2 a community/public sale ..
-3 the listing .. 💸

""if"" we follow that formula $well will come to stage 2 now and from here, we know it can go fast.

grapes had a floor of almost 3 eth without big b and without the time yogapetz had to build everything a successful token needs.

i don’t know which cex $well will be on, but i know the dots are there and also the team behind it.

that being said, the current floor of around 0.6 eth could be the biggest steal and return on investment in the whole space right now.

don’t sleep on such a big opportunity guys, and it’s not even wishful thinking; the metrics and the data are there.

6165,12898,Tyler Whittle | BIP-420 😺,"my bitcoin journey: the road to becoming a wizard 🧙‍♂️🪄

nine months ago, i knew almost nothing about bitcoin from a technical standpoint. i had just started working with the @taprootwizards in a part-time capacity, and it became glaringly obvious to me that all my ethereum knowledge was not going to cut it on bitcoin. next to the 10 years of experience that both udi & eric had, i felt completely out of my depth.

fast forward to today, i'm:
- teaching bitcoin fundamentals with @nonfungible_jan at @technicallybtc
- discussing crazy l2 constructions utilizing op_cat with @rot13maxi and @ercwl
- writing a lamport signature implementation on bitcoin for fun

but the road i walked to get to this point was one fraught with challenges and sacrifice.

---
my first day working with @udiwertheimer, i asked him for the fastest way i could level up my technical understanding of bitcoin. he recommended starting with programming bitcoin by ordinals enjoyoor @jimmysong. i'm not a dev by trade or training, but i didn't let that stop me.

every weekend in june, july, & september, i committed myself to working through a chapter of this book. 

at this point, i was still at my old vc job, working part-time for the taproot wizards, and trying to keep up with everything ordinals. this meant that every weekend i declined to hang out with friends, hardly saw my girlfriend, dropped my other hobbies, and hammered on the fundamentals of bitcoin programming.

this decision to sacrifice almost all other areas of life to dedicate time to bitcoin has become the story of my year. after programming bitcoin, it was bitvm. after bitvm, it was bip land. after bip land, it was and is op_cat.

becoming an expert in any space requires an immense amount dedication and resilience. anyone can put in this effort for a brief span. but to truly become great, you have to put in the work no one else sees, day in and day out, even when you don't want to. 

it has begun to pay off, but it's taken nearly a year of late nights, early mornings, and missed weekends to get to where i am. and along the way, there were no accolades, no boost in followers, only the internal reward of knowledge gained.

i plan to build legendary products with the taproot wizards, and the only way that happens is by continuing to push myself to be the absolute best at what i do. i know that if we achieve our goals, that will be the ultimate reward.

so to all the bitcoiners out there who are grinding in the shadows every day, i want to say:

i see the work you put in
i know the sacrifice it takes to be excellent
the work that is done in the dark
when no one is watching
when it's just you vs. yourself
keep working
keep grinding
challenge yourself to be better than you were yesterday
the success will come
and never forget the people who made sacrifices so that you could strive to become legendary

gonna keep my spot eth as long as there’s an easy narrative to ride i.e. etf and etf inflows but honestly after that i might just move on to full bitcoin/solana/alts portfolio and keep my exposure to eth as minimal as i can

6219,12954,Cardano YOD₳,"the edi dashboard presents 7 distinct graphs, each showcasing the results for 7 prominent blockchains: 

➡️#bitcoin 
➡️#bitcoincash
➡️#cardano
➡️#ethereum
➡️#litecoin
➡️#tezos
➡️#zcash

let's look at the first four metrics.

the nakamoto coefficient is a measure of a blockchain’s decentralization.

it’s determined by counting the minimum number of entities that collectively produce more than 50% of the total blocks within a given timeframe.

the output of this metric is an integer.

a higher nakamoto coefficient signifies a higher level of decentralization.

conversely, if the nakamoto coefficient were 1, it would imply that a single entity, such as a single pool, produces more than half of all blocks in the network, indicating a high level of centralization.

the result refers to entities (nodes) that can produce blocks, irrespective of the resources that may be delegated to these entities by several other entities.

for instance, miners delegate hash-rate to bitcoin pools. $ada stakers delegate coins to cardano pools.

see figure 1.

cardano, with a nakamoto coefficient of 58, significantly surpasses other blockchains in this metric. 

in comparison, bitcoin and ethereum have a significantly lower nakamoto coefficient of just 2. 

tezos, with a coefficient of 7, comes in second place.

community tools often report a nakamoto coefficient of around 35, which is approximately half of what is reported for cardano by the edi dashboard. 

this discrepancy between the scientists' results and the community tools warrants further investigation.

the gini coefficient represents the degree of inequality in block production. 

the output of the metric is a decimal number in [0,1]. 

values close to 0 indicate equality (all entities in the system produce the same number of blocks) and values close to 1 indicate inequality (one entity produces most or all blocks).

in a perfect scenario of absolute equality, each node in the network would generate an equal number of blocks over the same timeframe and receive identical rewards. 

however, this would necessitate a one-person-one-vote system, which is unattainable in a decentralized network. 

the number of blocks produced by each entity is contingent on the resources it has at its disposal, whether owned directly or delegated to it.

it's noteworthy that a majority of blockchain networks naturally tend towards increased inequality.

see figure 2.

cardano topped this metric with a score of 0.906. 

tezos followed closely in second place, scoring 0.967. 

bitcoin secured the third position with a score of 0.974.

entropy represents the expected amount of information in the distribution of blocks across entities. 

the output of the metric is a real number. typically, a higher value of entropy indicates higher decentralization (lower predictability).

in the context of blockchain networks, a higher entropy value is generally considered better for decentralization.

entropy measures the unpredictability or randomness of data. 

if the entropy is high, it means that the data is very random and therefore, it’s hard to predict. 

if the entropy is high, it’s harder to predict which node will produce the next block. 

this unpredictability contributes to the security and fairness of the network, as it prevents any single node from dominating the block production process.

it ensures that power and control are not concentrated in the hands of a few nodes, but are instead spread out across the network. 

this is a key aspect of maintaining a healthy and robust decentralized system.

see figure 3.

cardano took first place with a value of 8.12. in second place is tezos with a value of 5.28. third is bitcoin cash with a value of 3.63.

the herfindahl-hirschman index (hhi) is a measure of market concentration.

it is defined as the sum of the squares of the market shares (as whole numbers, e.g. 40 for 40%) of the entities in the system.

the output of the metric is a real number in (0, 10000). 

values close to 0 indicate low concentration (many entities produce a similar number of blocks) and values close to 10000 indicate high concentration (one entity produces most or all blocks).

the closer a market is to a monopoly, the higher the market’s concentration (and the lower its competition).

the u.s. department of justice has set the following thresholds for interpreting hhi values (in traditional markets):

➡️(0, 1500): competitive market
➡️[1500, 2500]: moderately concentrated market
➡️(2500, 10000): highly concentrated market

in a regular market, as in decentralization, high competitiveness is a healthy and desirable characteristic.

see figure 4.

cardano, tezos, and bitcoin cash, with values of 82.5, 604, and 1068 respectively, have emerged as the top performers. 

their networks exhibit high competitiveness, with numerous entities producing a comparable number of blocks.

in contrast, a moderate level of market concentration is observed in the case of other projects.

cardano won in all metrics, a success that can be linked to its status as one of the newest pos blockchain networks on the edi dashboard.

bitcoin, being the oldest blockchain, showed the poorest results in certain metrics and was generally subpar in others.

ethereum, a relatively older blockchain that transitioned from pow to pos, didn’t see substantial enhancements in decentralization following the switch. 

for instance, the nakamoto coefficient remained unchanged. the herfindahl-hirschman index (hhi) even experienced a decline. 

this result shows how significantly pos networks can differ in decentralization.

cardano has had pos longer than ethereum, yet the network is more decentralized.

decentralization is not only about network consensus. 

other aspects are important. 

for example, in governance, cardano might not be at its best because of genesis keys. 

however, the iog team will address this shortcoming, so cardano will improve in this metric over time, similar to the significant improvement seen after the shelley hardfork that brought staking. 

metrics related to governance are not yet available in the edi dashboard.",2024-03-04 14:06:00,False,210,57,12,2024,BTC,neutral,0.14402395,0.13272665,0.7232494

6311,13046,HEXscout,"😱 breaking: ehex chart plunge. the $hex token embarks on a new journey. phex soars simultaneously. what's happening? @richardheartwin has made a decisive statement: hex on pulsechain is the superior hex because it doesn't suffer from ethereum gas price issues and has long since gathered a massive investor base, which is positively reflected in trading volume and liquidity.

a massive reallocation from ehex to phex is the direct result. within 30 minutes, millions in liquidity were also withdrawn from hex on ethereum. the founder of hex's wakeup call seemingly acts as a beacon for the market. the vision of ""a strong hex, if investors would concentrate on phex, which, due to its negligible gas prices, is unrestrictedly mass-appealing"".

the future must show whether the market will sustainably follow the founder. there was once a cautious warning shot from heart shortly after the launch of phex, but the question about ehex remained stable at a low level in the ratio.

the fact is, richard protected the complete assets of all hex investors by duplicating it 100% on phex during the launch of pulsechain. and within hours after the launch, phex was already valued significantly more than ehex. transaction volume, liquidity immediately skyrocketed compared to ehex, phex was a winner from the mass from the start.

now, it's up to the hex investors whether they will follow their founder, take the swing of today's reallocation and unite to make phex great, or despite richard's clear statement, attempt to keep ehex in a stable ratio to phex. however, such a plan might be difficult, as the founder's clear statement made it evident that ehex can no longer expect support from him. ehex was banned from the https://t.co/9rkihrozda website a long time ago.

the objective fact is, richard is right. #hex is a smart contract created for the function of staking. if the fees on the ethereum chain are so high that only large investors can afford to stake, the smart contract fails its purpose for the mass of investors on this chain. thus, it should be seen as investor protection by richard when he points out this fact, especially now, in the midst of extremely high ethereum fees, witnessing ehex investors massively unstaking their stakes unprofitably.

for hex on pulsechain, the clear direction could become a liberating strike. the divisiveness of ""which hex should i buy?"", as assessed by the founder, is cleared away. and hexicans have the power to make hex one rocket again.

anyone acting as a gatekeeper or hater now, thinking it's wise to deceive their followers with a one-sided hex chart presentation, is not only digging their own grave of increasing incredulity but is likely to soon experience that richard heart is a founder who knows precisely when it's time to give an asset a boost. don't bet against richard, as it has never ended well! 🚀🚀🚀",2024-03-10 16:59:00,False,334,94,37,2024,BTC,neutral,0.17000608,0.24149553,0.5884984

6320,13055,DeFi Cheetah 🐆 ¤ 🦙🦇🔊,"13 march will be the most important date for @ethereum since the merge. 
tldr: 
- it will undergo a hardfork to implement eip-4844 (proto-danksharding) which brings huge +ve impact on l2s, as fees on l2s would then be 10x cheaper than it is today. 
- this will create a flywheel that isn't possible on l1s: the more the users, the cheaper the fees, and more users attract more devs and dapps, which further drive down the fees with even more users.

context:
- to understand how the l2 cost structure can be improved significantly, we need to understand there is fixed cost and variable cost for running an l2:
1. fixed l2 operator costs: to expend the computational resources to process the rollup data, i.e., maintain a transaction pool, sequence batches, compute state roots/state diffs/validity proofs, etc. the cost is fixed since it won't change much compared to the network load and traffic.
2. variable l1 data publication costs: once operators have assembled a large enough set of tx, they will post a compressed summary of the set to l1. it is variable as the cost depends very much on how much data is posted on l1. this is the main driver for l2 fees.
- data is published on l1 by simply posting it as ‘calldata’, a txn attribute which allows the sender to add an arbitrary sequence of bytes. 
- the costs associated with posting through calldata are a large expense for l2s. according to the dune rollup economics dashboard by @0xkofi, l2s spent 15k+ eth (>$60m usd) writing to ethereum in december of 2023 alone!
- after dencun, eip-4844 will create space for blobs of data which can be used by l2s for settlement instead of calldata, reducing fees for l2s by at least an order of magnitude.

eip-4844 in brief:
- each block can have up to 6 total blobs
- each blob stores up to 128kb of data. if the entire 128kb is not used, the tx sender still pays for 128kb of blob space (some research about the timing for l2s to wait and fill a blob entirely, and/or coordinate with other l2s to share blob space.).
- blobs are only required to be stored for 4096 epochs (~18 days), which are considered available long enough for all actors of l2s to retrieve, but short enough to keep disk use manageable. this allows blobs to be priced much cheaper than calldata, which is stored forever.
- eip-4844 will create a new blob gas market, which will operate similarly to eip-1559, varying the blob base fee based on supply and demand: if there are more blobs in the block than the target, blob base fee is increased, and vice versa

it is expected that l2 activities will skyrocket with much much cheaper fee, so does the number of l2s. the next imminent issue @ethereum has to solve is liquidity fragmentation: @drakefjustin with @benafisch from @espressosys and others are actively working on universal synchronous composability where l2s which are 'based' can interact seamlessly among one another, via shared sequencing on l1 and real-time settlement. i view it as a strategic move with the benefit of the foresight of l2 development after dencun upgrade.",2024-03-10 21:26:00,False,313,82,22,2024,BTC,neutral,0.2161575,0.110860765,0.67298174

highlights:
- quantum computers could potentially break the security of ethereum, making it possible to steal users' funds by reversing the encryption that protects private keys.
-the ethereum blockchain can be updated (hard fork) to protect users' funds in the event of a quantum attack, requiring users to download new wallet software.
-most users' private keys are generated through a series of hash calculations, which provides a foundation for creating a recovery mechanism.
-a proposed ethereum improvement proposal (eip) includes steps like reverting transactions after theft is detected, disabling traditional transactions, and introducing new transaction types for enhanced security.
-the use of stark proofs for transactions allows for the secure transition of accounts to a quantum-resistant state, ensuring the safety of users' funds in a post-quantum world.

but regrettably, eth has still been underperforming for years. that's about to change.

eth's underperformance these past years comes down imo to three things

1. eth has been seen as illegitimate

many people, including institutional investors, seem to have expected the us govt to declare eth a security and/or remain hostile to (or even try to shut down) ethereum.

the eth etf is expected in may and unambiguously, instantly makes eth globally legitimate forever.

there seems to be agreement among etf experts that it's become legally and politically impossible for the sec to deny the eth etf. and, blackrock.

2. l2s have been viewed as clunky

for all the hassle of bridging to new chains and the resulting fragmentation, l2 fees are still pretty high.

eip-4844 blobs launch next week and fix this.

l2 fees may be expected to remain low even as growth explodes, due to blobs having their own fee market, validiums, blob count increases in future hard forks, and many incoming tech items.

at the same time, the ongoing work of our amazing l2 ecosystems and wallets is steadily solving distribution, ux, and fragmentation.

for example, base is on the cusp of onboarding coinbase cex users directly to l2 without requiring them to withdraw to a self custody wallet.

~100m coinbase exchange users will be able to ""connect wallet"" to uniswap or any eth app from the comfort of their custodial account.

l2s are becoming truly cheap to use at scale and buttery smooth.

the final item driving eth's underperformance these past years is

3. l2s have been seen as parasitic to eth

many people still think l2s harm eth by siphoning users, capital, fees, and network effects to l2.

in reality, eth has a fundamentally symbiotic relationship with l2s.

this l2<>l1 symbiosis is about to become widely understood and put to rest the incorrect notion that l2s are parasitic to eth. here's why-

the theory that eth and l2s are symbiotic goes like this:

consider the coming future where billions of users and trillions of $ are on l2. this would obviously imply a huge increase in l1 bridging, settlement, and da activity. that activity is direct growth for the l1 hub and feeds into the eth valuation.

this is not a complex theory. but both serious crypto investors and newcomers have found it mostly uncompelling.

what's changing now is that we finally have data to support the theory.

great sites to explore the l2<>l1 symbiosis include l2beat, growthepie, and some dune dashboards.

the new data show there will be many large l2s- not only a few- using l1 as the hub.

the new data show that l2s can be relied upon for the long term to pay significant fees to the l1 and depend on the l1 for a growing variety of use cases, including settlement, da, bridging, token registration, and l2 sequencer coordination.

the new data show that l2 growth and l1 growth happen together:

at the same time l2 growth is exploding, l1 activity is strengthening across the board, such as in l1 defi, bridging, and token/protocol deployments.

what we're seeing is an expansion to l2 while the l1 keeps growing. not a migration to l2.

as a result of these new data and new efforts to visualize and communicate l2<>l1 symbiosis, the once-popular view that l2s are parasitic to eth is on life support and will soon die.

in short

- eth has been seen as illegitimate. the eth etf in may fixes this.

- l2s have been viewed as clunky. blobs next week and general growth are fixing this.

- l2s have been seen as parasitic to eth. the latest data on l2<>l1 symbiosis fixes this.

as these items get solved, the reasons for eth's underperformance these past years are ending.

eth is about to become a consensus bet.

i joined polygon labs because i felt that it had the best technology to enable a future for ethereum to scale and it had a solid group of leaders and builders. i can say that is still true, and even better, there are efforts in place to go beyond blockchain scaling and help the wider community.

the labs legal policy team launched the value prop (https://t.co/wffenqvju7), @0xpolygonmiden is building unique privacy tech, and @0xpolygonid (soon to spin off) is an amazing privacy preserving id solution. the point is, polygon labs is laser focused on the agg layer and cdk in 2024 on the tech. side, but our dedication to the wider ecosystem and being a force for good is shown by our actions across other domains.

i love the people i work with! beyond being talented, they are fun to be around and are collaborative. i have fun going into work every day, which is a super rare thing for people to say! i am very lucky!

under the leadership of @aliciakatz and @ajaypv4, the protocol developer community team i am on is doing great things. expect 10000% more visibility on what we are doing as the next few months progress 👀
follow @0xabix @adidshaft @kenilshahh from the team!

i want to give a special shout-out to my friend @mihailobjelic who brought me into the org. i had known since before polygon was even a thing and have seen polygon grow from it's infancy when i was an advisor to today.

the choice was obvious, which is why so many made the right one. maybe in the bull market ehex will get pulled along, but the higher its price, the more economic energy will be lost to eth fees. and that energy lost could have been more coins bought.

tldr; y'all are blaming a tweet because y'all moved all the liquidity and sold into what was left because you wanted to move to the beautiful shining city on the hill hex on pulsechain.

the sooner you take responsibility for your actions, or realize it's market forces, the better it will be for you. probably blaming guys that held while everyone else sold...

here are the sequence of events:

➔ scheduled for 6:32 utc, the upgrade commenced but failed to finalize on goerli testnet as anticipated.
➔ finality crucial for irreversible transaction confirmation & block addition in blockchain networks.
➔ dencun's deployment on goerli marks phase one of a comprehensive approach towards implementing ""proto-danksharding.""
➔ proto-danksharding aims to enhance data storage efficiency & reduce transaction costs for layer-2 blockchains.
➔ testnets like goerli simulate real-world blockchain environments, ensuring thorough testing before mainnet deployment.
➔ next phases involve upgrades on sepolia & holesky testnets, paving the way for broader implementation.
➔ dencun signifies ethereum's major upgrade since shapella last march, pivotal for its transition to proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.

eth etf next? well, stay tuned for further updates as ethereum continues its evolution towards a more scalable and sustainable blockchain ecosystem! transition to proof-of-stake!

but this will be more, and the hint here is our ability to run multiple vms in parallel in the same sovereignchain with direct composable actions between executors, all leveraging a higher module. we also have the examples with evm already working.

a well designed architecture, where you can run, launch and interoperate between multiple vms, deploying any dapp for any language. furthermore, it also means interoperability between tokens as well.

imagine deploying products from evm/svm/cosmos/other chains on a sovereignchain and have those interact with already existing and new products from the multiversx ecosystem. be it tokens, nfts, socialfi, games, defi.

exciting news awaits on the horizon! after careful consideration and discussions with the @monad_xyz  team behind the scenes, we've decided to take a bold step in building the monadians.

rather than minting our collection on the ethereum mainnet, we've chosen to hold out for the grand launch of the monad mainnet in q4 2024. this decision isn't about delay, but about delivering an unparalleled experience for our future nft holders.

while this adjustment might entail a bit more patience, we assure you that the rewards will be well worth the anticipation. the monad mainnet promises a realm of possibilities, where creativity knows no bounds and innovation thrives.

get ready to embark on an extraordinary adventure with us. together, we'll pioneer a new era excellence, filled with endless opportunities and unforgettable moments.

6536,13277,Marketing.!!CEO,"the implementation of eip-1559 on the #shibarium network signifies the adaptation of #ethereum’s transaction fee mechanism to #shibarium. this could mean that #shibarium will also have a similar fee burning and dynamic fee mechanism.
the main innovations brought by eip-1559 in #ethereum are:
base fee: automatically adjusted based on the current network congestion and is the minimum fee that must be paid for every transaction.
tip: an extra fee that users can pay to miners if they want their transactions to be confirmed more quickly.
fee burning: the base fee collected with each transaction is “burned” by the network, meaning it is removed from circulation.
the application of eip-1559 to shibarium could contribute to making transaction fees more predictable and efficient, enhancing network security, and giving the shibarium token economy a deflationary structure. additionally, it could enable shibarium to reduce the load on the ethereum network, providing faster and cheaper transactions.

2) ethereum switched from proof of work to proof of stake which changes the thesis of what hinman/clayton based their analysis on to give ethereum a non security classsification.

3) gary gensler refuses to state if ethereum is a security or not. he won't echo the statements of hinman and clayton. even before congress he refused to answer.

4) gary will most likely take the ethereum etf situation to the courts. recently, cftc chair rostin behnam spoke before congress highlighting the difference in view of the cftc vs sec on ethereum being a commodity vs security.

5) the sec and gary gensler approved prometheum's license to custody ethereum as a security. in my interview with aaron kaplan he echoed gary's classification of altcoins as ""digital asset securities""

6569,13311,Ⱥlex | france.algo 🇫🇷,"i believe the entire crypto industry will always be grateful to #ethereum and @vitalikbuterin for paving the way for web3. 

$eth deserves everyone's respect for that! 👑

however, after almost 10 years of existence, it’s becoming more and more evident that ethereum is definitely not fit for purpose and probably never will be.

#algorand, along with other blockchains/dlts, in much less time, is doing what ethereum has still failed to do: providing a great and smooth experience for the average user and having a significant impact on the lives of millions of non-crypto people around the world, through real adoption of the technology.

and that's 100% understandable, just like the internet, the first to come is not always the winner.

i'm not talking about l2, which, imho, are just a bandage on a wooden leg… l2s are useless when other l1s, much more efficient, more scalable, and especially more secure, exist.

i like #ethereum, and i definitely don't see $eth being flipped before a few years, mainly because the market is still too immature and speculative to be rational.

i mean, it’s very likely that more than 90% of eth investors have probably never made a single transaction on it to realize how unsuitable it is for mass adoption.

but the more the market grows and matures, the more ethereum will probably have difficulty keeping up.

don't be fooled, although still early days, real world adoption of blockchain is already here, but definitely not on $eth.

just as an example, each day, millions of people board planes thanks to #algorand or use $algo technology in their everyday lives without even knowing it. the biggest institutions are developing game-changing solutions on top of it (digital euro, tips solution, fifa, etc)...

$hbar also has many real use cases (ex: avery dennison), $avax is also gaining nice traction, #ada too…

unlike #btc, ethereum is not untouchable, many people often forget that in 2017 $xrp had already flipped $eth. it's also naive to think that businesses or retail outside of crypto will want to use ethereum as a priority rather than another blockchain/dlt. they just want reliable and affordable technology.

hey #ethereum!  i realize asking you to look at pulsechain because it's faster and cheaper isn't going to do jack shit.

there's dozens of evms that fi that description.

but here's just a few things pulsechain has that others dont:

some great aggregators for best trade execution

trustless otcs

leveraging and lending platforms

2 native trustless stable coins backed by millions of dollars worth of their respective collateral.  another stable with backing by 10+ institutions.

defi yield automation tools

several dexs and nft platforms

gambling, mixing, pooling,oracles, memes... and the list goes on and on.  with all of these things built on chain.  not bridged in tokens only with the protocol still running on eth.

pulsechain literally has more building than any chain has done in the same period. most builders are easily reachable to offer support and assistance.  

the community itself is massive, with many diverse influencers and educators.  there's unlimited avenues for growing your own user base on pulsechain.

these are just a handful of things that make this cheaper and faster chain better than the next cheaper and faster chain.

people will add to the reasons below.

blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, has taken significant steps towards integrating digital assets into its portfolio by submitting a request to the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) to launch a tokenized investment fund named the ""blackrock usd institutional digital liquidity fund"" (buidl) on the ethereum blockchain. this move underscores blackrock's increasing embrace of digital assets, following its introduction of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (etf) and application to launch an ishares ethereum trust, which it hopes to list on the nasdaq, pending regulatory approval.

the buidl token was created on march 4, 2024, with a single address holding 100 buidl tokens. according to the fund's prospectus, it requires a minimum investment of $100,000, operating similarly to a short-term money market fund focused on investments in short-duration securities like commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and floating rate notes, with a substantial portion of its assets in cash reserves.

however, obtaining sec approval for such digital asset initiatives poses a challenge, given the regulatory body's recent history of scrutinizing and delaying decisions on crypto-related products, including blackrock's own application for a spot ethereum etf. this reflects the broader context of regulatory actions against numerous cryptocurrency enterprises, highlighting the complexities of integrating traditional finance with the evolving digital asset landscape.",2024-03-20 11:54:00,False,1096,220,76,2024,BTC,neutral,0.2575565,0.024307871,0.7181357

solana is going to have and needs to have l2s and/or rollups.

i don't think these will manifest exactly like the ethereum ecosystem, but there will always be app builders at scale that want more tps, less competition for blockspace, lower fees, and that want to own more of the aggregate economics that their business generates.

it is insane that drip paid $10,000 in on-chain fees last week plus a plethora of other costs at the rpc level and in our cloud, not to mention the time rewriting our backend.

this is not a complaint, just an incentive-alignment problem that i'm not sure how to address at the base layer: the very apps that bring traffic and customers to the chain are rewarded with increased infra cost when the token appreciates in value, in part due to their efforts.

i think many app builders will be happy to make calculated decentralization tradeoffs to have favorable economics and tps. and for users that want it, being able to pay extra to optionally secure their assets at the base layer makes tons of sense.

some ethereum bears have been saying for years (and still say) that compliance and regulation will eventually stop ethereum's real-world asset growth in its tracks.

it's a popular view, especially among people who actually work in compliance and regulation.

but if you want to know about water, don't ask a fish.

tokenizing everything is far too useful to be stopped by regulations.

the game has changed. the world's many commercial and political interests aren't going to abandon the promise of tokenization because of the old rules of the game.

life finds a way.

we have already seen many examples of tokenization finding a path to growth.

two of my favorite examples are

- favorable tokenization jurisdictions, such as germany, switzerland, and bermuda

- clever market design, like how ondo's flux market lets kyc'd holders borrow from permissionless lenders. or how blackrock's kyc buidl is collateral for the kyc'd usdm but usdm has permissionless secondary markets

the view that regulations will curb real-world asset growth is not only pessimistic but also totally out of line with the facts.

we are seeing a cambrian explosion in the quantity and diversity of real-world assets, as well as hyper-growth in key metrics, such as rwa tvl, the number of funded rwa companies, and the bench depth of talented people working in rwa. https://t.co/0hv6wr3doq

6757,13500,🥖Tokenicer✲⥃⬢,"i'm starting to see the $qnt erc20 fud again...

so let me say this for the 14,881,364th time, once for each qnt token.

the erc20 standard for qnt is purely so that it's accessible on a public permissionless chain.

they've chose ethereum as it's stood the test of time and is regarded as the most well known blockchain with smart contract support.

but as we know, overledger isn't even a blockchain hence why they've created qrc20 smart contract.

as once you move onto overledger, the standards of erc20 no longer apply, rather you will operate under the token standard of overledger, qrc20.

this enables multi-chain interoperability and deployment of assets.

we've already seen this in action with the first public project utilizing overledger in galileo $leox.

their vision in tokenizing the luxury space is one that calls for the needs of multi-chain capabilities, as brands will be looking to create dlt agnostic access of these branded goods in pnft form.

the leox token is not only qrc20, but their nfts are qrc721, which is the nft standard on overledger.

once again, this enables agnostic interoperability of nft assets onto multiple blockchains... essential to the future operations of galileo.

so what happens if ethereum goes down?

this has ironically been a growing concern with the erc20 fud, it's ironic because ethereum has still yet to show any signs of network failure.

sure, one could argue the network is terrible to use due to the insane amounts of gas fees & i would agree.

but the point about ethereum standing the test of time still certainly stands & is why qnt continues to live on the ethereum blockchain today.

but hypothetically if something were to happen, just keep in mind the operations on overledger aren't even on ethereum.... it's not even on a blockchain.

it just so happens that blockchains are one of the technologies that can interoperate in their network.

the operations are on overledger & in return the team could easily convert qnt onto another blockchain within the same day.

finally onto one last bonus point to further counteract the fud of qnt tokens.

there is often concern of what the token is used for on overledger & here below we can see quant themselves had directly answered this.

similar to ethereum or any other l1 that has a native gas token, qnt also serves as the fuel to overledger.

this is in combination with qnt also being used as a form of tokenized licenses & security for gateways in the near future.

though the biggest differentiator here is that users don't have to directly pay in qnt.

rather they can simply pay in fiat, which ensures a much more seamless process than sending crypto tokens from a wallet.

simply pay with a debit/credit card and the fiat is converted to qnt in such a seamless manner that you're thinking you're paying with fiat!

well, technically you are paying with fiat.

the people saying ""token not needed"" are indirectly complimenting how seamless quant's made their solution.",2024-03-25 02:25:00,False,226,65,7,2024,BTC,neutral,0.12009297,0.33271712,0.5471899

ℹ️ about ambient

ambient is a decentralized exchange (dex) protocol that allows for two-sided amms combining concentrated and ambient constant-product liquidity on any arbitrary pair of blockchain assets.

ambient runs the entire dex inside a single smart contract, where individual amm pools are lightweight data structures instead of separate smart contracts.

this feature, along with other design decisions, makes ambient the most efficient ethereum-based dex.

🗣️ quotes

""we are excited to leverage our market data to support the pyth network ecosystem. by providing pricing data from our deep, liquid pools, we look forward to increasing security, efficiency, and transparency in financial data on-chain. as ambient grows we look forward to providing market data for more assets, and playing a role in the growth of the pyth network."" — doug colkitt, founder of ambient finance.",2024-03-25 15:02:00,False,448,48,20,2024,BTC,positive,0.8779696,0.0021208574,0.119909525

6845,13592,{ thouny },"the complete guide to defi on sui

since its birth nearly 10 months ago, sui has seen tremendous growth of its defi ecosystem:

+ $700m tvl
+ $200m daily volume 
+ 60% of bridged assets from ethereum via wormhole land on sui

with this post, i propose to show you around the sui defi ecosystem and more, while trying to be exhaustive. we'll go through all existing protocols, the different wallets to interact with them and the current incentives available.

wallets

depending on how you're used to interact with blockchains here is a list of available wallets on sui (from most to least favorite).

desktop: mystenlabs sui wallet, @suiet_wallet, @ethoswalletxyz, @nightly_app, @ martian_wallet 
mobile: @surf_wallet, @mofalabs, @nightly_app, @ethoswalletxyz, @ elli_wallet, @ fewchawallet, @ glasswalletapp  

you should know that some wallets provide zklogin as a self-custodial way to create and manage a keypair using social logins. now we can jump to the interesting part!

lending

@scallop_io is the protocol with the largest tvl on sui. this is probably due to the fact that it is open-source and several protocols are built on top of it. scallop recently refilled the incentive pools with 750k sui for 2 weeks increasing the aprs up to 31%. its particularity is that lent assets are separated from collateral, making the protocol more resilient. they recently raised $3m and launch their token $sca.

@navi_protocol is the second highest tvl, first one if we include @volo_sui (liquid staking) that they recently acquired. they raised $2m and launched their token $navx via an ido. 800k sui and navx are used to incentive users for 2 weeks (up to 31% apr). the dapp is more beginner-friendly than scallop but provide less insights. currently a point campaign is ongoing but we have very little info about it.

@suilendprotocol is the new kid on the block. it is the sister protocol of solend which is widely used on solana. suilend is currently in beta access so you need a beta pass to join (dm me if you don't have one). the ui is pretty close to solend and the user & global information is displayed in a clever way. the tvl is growing rapidly as limits increase and the team hints at a potential airdrop in the future. thanks to the incentives and leverage, some users reached +100% apr.

@bucket_protocol is a cdp (users can borrow a stable coin $buck by depositing blue chip assets as collateral). they recently refreshed their ui which looks amazing. the team is working hard to expand buck ecosystem by partnering with other projects like @ buck_you_legend or @goosebumps_farm (that's mine). aprs are currently insane with up to 8% for borrowing buck and 70% on usd pairs via aftermath and cetus.

dex

@deepbookonsui is the central limit order book built by sui foundation and other contributors. it is a public good enabling deeper liquidity on sui. as we'll see below, many protocols are using it under the hood.

@cetusprotocol is the largest dex. it's a clmm (uni v3). they completed a seed round fundraising last year and launched their token $cetus. the protocol is built on both aptos and sui and provide swapping via their liquidity pool but also an orderbook interface using deepbook. they have a launchpad for ido (launched navx). you can farm 50% apr on sui/hasui and 370% on sui/usdc.

@kriyadex has many cool features. in addition to an amm and interface for deepbook orderbook, they built tools for memecoins like an analyzer, coin creator and airdrop. they also developed features to use other protocols more efficiently. ""strats"" allows you to leverage your position in lending protocol in 1-click. they have a campaign in progress around their future token and you can find 69% apr on vsui/sui.

@flowx_finance is an amm and a launchpad that they used to launch their own token $flx. what is nice on the dapp is the analytics page they built for sui-based coins. they are close to $scb and worked on suipearl (yield optimizer) and poseidollar (stablecoin).

@turbos_finance is also a clmm with a feature to use deepbook. $turbos is the incentive token. the protocol gives access to 73% apr on usdt/usdc and 310% on sui/usdc.

@bluemove_oa is primarily a nft marketplace on sui and aptos but also a dex, mostly used for memecoins.

@bluefinapp is a trading platform for perpetuals. they reached $400m+ volume in a single day.

@abexfinance is a protocol for trading derivatives such as btc, eth, sol, doge and more.

@aftermathfi is a dex aggregator (similar to jup on solana) providing many cool features in addition to the best prices on sui. they support dynamic gas (pay the gas fees with any coin) thanks to sponsored transactions as well as zklogin. that means you can create an account on aftermath with google, then top it up with usdc and directly start trading. they currently have up to 140% apr on sui/usd pairs. aftermath has their own lst $afsui.

@interest_dinero is a special case. the team built an amm, lending / borrowing and a lst (i could help on this one) but shut down activities due to the lack of incentives. they are now deployed on movement devnet and are looking forward to the incentivized testnet. additionally they are currently building @su_protocol.

yield optimizers

@strater_sui features many vaults with different strategies with yield farming and leverage. they already integrated aftermath, bucket, scallop, navi and more. with it you can maximize your earnings easily. currently there is 2000%+ with leveraged sui staking using bucket.

@moledefi provides savings and leveraged yield farming. many features to maximize yield are proposed on their dapp. i suggest you to go through their tutorial / docs to get a complete overview of their offer.

@kai_finance_sui is an open-source yield aggregator featuring 3 vaults (sui, usdc, usdt) that are built on top of scallop. the proposed apys are about 20% higher than scallop's aprs.

@suipearlfi designed strategies using flowx and scallop under the hood. they primarily launched without any strategy and attracted users with the $prl token that could be earned by farming $ostr with high yield.

rwa

@sudofinance is a real-world synthetic asset trading platform on sui. they started by launching a $slp coin allowing holders to earn 100% of the protocol revenue. now they are preparing to launch their ""s"" card nft to incentivize activity on the dapp.

@ondofinance launched $usdy, a coin backed by short-term us treasuries and bank demand deposits, on sui. 

other

@typusfinance is a great looking protocol for options. if you're not familiar with this financial product (like me), they have writtten comprehensive medium articles that you can read. in addition, they have created a beautiful nft collection designed by studio mirai serving as loyalty passes. by interacting with the dapp, users can level up their tails and earn huge rewards.

@haedalprotocol is a liquid staking protocol issuing $hasui. users can either choose the validator they wish to stake with, or the automatic mode that optimizes the positions. two other lsts are available on sui: $vsui and $afsui. 

@mazufinance simplifies yield farming in the sui ecosystem via a single yield-bearing token. the protocol should launch when i'm done with the smart contracts!

@vaporprotocol is a reserve currency similar to olympusdao. they recently launched their token on flowx.

@poseidollar is an algorithmic stablecoin.

@suibaonsui and @cenbotorg are two trading bots on sui.

nfts

@snotraprotocol is building a lending / borrowing platform for nfts.

@degenhive is currently developing an ambitious dapp mixing defi with nfts and powered by a social graph.

@tradeportxyz is an aggregator with in depth analytics. the team has built on many chains including sui, near, stacks and aptos (ethereum and solana coming soon). they are behind indexer(.)xyz and developed a discord bot enabling holder verification and notifying traders when a sale occurs.

@hyperspacesui is born from the famous solana nft aggregator. like tradeport, it's an aggregator and launchpad as well. 

@clutchy_io was the most hyped marketplace and launchpad when sui mainnet launched. they had a lot of technical issues at first then disappeared for a while. now they're back with a new branding so let's see what happens next.

bluemove was one of the first marketplaces on aptos and sui.

wrapping up

i could also mention @desuilabs, @suilette, @pandora_finance in the gambling domain. @karrier_one and @chirpdewi for depin. @suia2023 for socialfi.

so i guess that's all for the moment. i won't go into the games because there are a bunch of them and even more not yet revealed.

as you can see the ecosystem is extremely rich and varied. given the fact that all this was born within a 10 months timeframe (more if we count dead projects and testnet period), it makes me super bullish on sui.

obviously this couldn't have been possible without the incredible work of @mysten_labs, @suifoundation and all other contributors, so hats off guys. i'm looking forward to celebrate with all of you at basecamp!",2024-03-28 17:54:00,False,319,95,26,2024,BTC,positive,0.52874064,0.015674084,0.4555853

6852,13600,Robert Sasu,"the difference of research and development of ethereum 2015-2018 vs after eth pos is completely different, and it changed for the worst.

earlier, there was so much optimism and drive for creation, more features, more scaling, parallel execution, sharding, resolving governance, fixing privacy, and now, we read that l1 does not have to move fast anymore and it could rely on l2 development. security is pushed towards account abstraction or wallets, sc safety is outsourced to auditors, tests. and nobody is tackling the existing problems of reentrancy, wallet drains, math problems.

it is clear that if ethereum would do better, the whole crypto world would be in a better place, and i try to find ways in which ethereum should move forward, but it is more than clear that there is no real thinking about developing it further, or to acknowledge problems. when ethereum started it wanted to be the internet computer, a general computation layer to run anything. with the new direction, it only wants to notarise blobs. i fairly think if someone create a system specially for this, it will be much better. i think the scope has been fairly reduce, and if you want to become more than a financial chain, you need to increase the scope, not reduce.

the #blockchain as system has to reach its most optimal form and to create an environment where developers can really enjoy building. in evm systems and with erc tokens, with building on l2s and integrating bridges, it is not fun to develop, and it is also insanely expensive, as well as audits. how can a new developer leave in this kind of world?

it is more and more clear that l2 scaling is not scaling, you have the same applications, same dexs, same teams deploying same contracts on multiple chains.  and it is put in the conclusions as well: ""arhitect application so that it supports every l2"". this is not something you would need to do in a scaling web2 ecosystem. you just create an application, deploy, and people can simply interact with it. 

in the current form i do not see a good future for this. it is all of a moneys game. it is clear that incentive wise, there are hardly any incentives to follow guidance of @vitalikbuterin for creating better l2s - as there is no support yet for enshrined processes. it is most clear that there is little incentive to build any new feature on the l1 level, as noone is paying for that. it is more sexy to launch a new l2 which the same code, no innovation, and invite people to launch the same old applications. fragmented liquidity, fragmented ux, fragmented apps, no composability.

there are a few questions in my mind seeing that the chain with most liquidity is not actually evolving: 

how could i help, starting from the position of what i learnt and from the position of #multiversx ecosystem?

what about all the innovation happening in multiple places, how can those contribute to a better blockchain world?",2024-03-29 11:44:00,False,129,33,11,2024,BTC,neutral,0.15975171,0.39619914,0.4440492

lcx earn is a tokenized bond denominated in bitcoin, ethereum, euro and lcx token issued by lcx ag - the company behind lcx. the bond is endorsed (official word for approved) by the financial market authority and officially available in 30 european countries. 

lcx ag has 1 million chf share capital, publishes risk and financials disclosures, is headquartered in liechtenstein - a highly reputable country with a aaa rating by standard & poor’s.

it works like any corporate bond issued by microstrategy, bmw or deutsche bank. yield is provided and generated by the company. lcx is highly profitable. guaranteeing this fixed yield is very predictable and paid by profits. yield in particular for this product are generated via liquidity providing, staking or general business operations.

in the prospectus it says: “the proceeds from the issue will be used by the issuer at its own discretion, but according to plan, in particular to increase the liquidity and the trading volume on the platform of lcx ag, to continue to operate and expand the lcx platform  (trading platform for cryptocurrencies), furthermore to advance the development of products and procedures for the settlement and securing of trading transactions in the area of cryptocurrencies and the development of cryptocurrencies, as well as to implement further approval procedures before the liechtenstein
financial market authority. however, if
necessary, the proceeds of the issue will also be used for only one of the aforementioned purposes.”

note: investment period for lcx earn was 12 month and is closed at the moment. we will extend and re-open the investment period after regulatory approvals. follow @lcx to keep updated.

his picks cover layer-1, gaming coins and even ai cryptos🤯

here are all 17 projects + @zssbecker comments on each:👇

-------------------

⚙️layer-1⚙️

1. $sol - @solana 

""many people nowadays are skipping $eth and $bnb are go straight down to $sol""

2. $avax - @avax 

""i think $avax is going to flip cardano very soon and it's going to pull up right underneath solana""

🤖ai coins🤖

3. $paal - @paalmind 

""after the recent crypto dip, $paal is in a good buying zone again""

4. $aioz - @aioznetwork 

""aioz network is one project i've added a really large position in. in the past month, $aioz has done really well – despite the market being negative. that's because the tech behind this applied to everything. $aioz should have a market cap similar to $rndr and $tao""

5. $dsync - @destranetwork 

""another position i've added in ai – which i think is the gem of gems – would be destra network. i think $dsync has a very similar chance to do a run very similar to opsec. i also think destra network is very similar to akash network""

6. $opsec - @opseccloud 

""i think opsec is going to a billion dollar market cap. if you see the price action of $opsec of the past month – it's definitely pushing up. this coin has that beach call effect""

🎮crypto gaming🎮

7-8. $beam $super - @buildonbeam @superversedao 

""gaming is very simple. you can literally get $beam and $super and call it a day. that's just a good old basic crypto gaming exposure. i believe $super will have a multi billion dollar market cap because it's integrated in all of gaming crypto""

9-12. $pixel $ron $imx $ilv - @pixels_online @ronin_network @immutable @illuviumio 

""those coins are all fantastic as well""

13. $sfund - @seedifyfund 

""there are some no brainer investment in crypto gaming like seedify - which i think can easily go to $10-$15. you can always put money in $sfund – it just simply works""

14-15. $myria $alu - @myria @alturanft

""i think $myria is super undervalued right now as well as altura - which i think is also massively undervalued right now""

16. $cah - @moontropica 

""the one gaming coin that really stuck out to me recently was moon tropica - because even when bitcoin dumps, $cah just kept going up. one of the reasons i went pretty heavy in $cah is that they got a game, they got all the narratives and the community reminds me of one of the freakiest of memecoin communities""

17. $sidus - @galaxy_sidus 

""one coin that has just shrugged off the dip completely has been $sidus – and that's because they're making a lot of the right moves. they have a game and a launchpad but they also keep burning tons and tons of coins""",2024-03-23 16:00:00,False,875,191,72,2024,BTC,positive,0.69231606,0.01352373,0.29416022

this month, we are honored to have our art, technology, and community finally come to fruition.

🎖️ through the e7l-s technology we bring to solana, nft drops will be given to holders who achieve certain merits throughout time.

🎖️ with our various collaborations, there will be traits that provide exclusive benefits such as token airdrops to their holders upon mint.

🎖️ a number of veterans will be inscribed directly on chain. veterans will be the first collection to
incorporate inscriptions this way into a mint.

🎖️ our veterans art factory led by our art & design team will help bring artists from web2 into web3 to share their work with us and the ecosystem.

more information on all of these topics will be released soon. and with it, a very unique collaboration to commemorate this new saga on solana.

7179,14163,Beanie,"some misunderstand my post about capital flowing from solana to sei. allow me to explain👇

solana is infinitely greater in all metrics than sei rn. tvl, users, onchain activity etc. this is an apples and oranges comparison. i’m not calling for a sei flip of solana. thats an extreme outlier situation. anything is possible but it’s unlikely.

solana comes off such a huge base. it’s now established. just like ethereum did last cycle when solana creeped up on it and attracted some of its liquidity. i i see sei doing the same to solana this cycle. it didn’t take alot of capital to move the needle of the solana ecosystem last cycle and i think the same will be true with sei this cycle.

sei is first out of the gate with the hottest l1 narrative this cycle - parallelized evm. which should allow it to attract even more capital from the ethereum ecosystem. which is infinitely larger than solana even.

what’s important to note is that during last cycle sol ended up doing a 300x vs a 10x for eth. of course this is risk adjusted. it’s infinitely riskoer to be in sei vs sol rn. same as it was to be in sol vs eth last cycle.

i’ve placed my bets accordingly. everybody should do the same based on their own risk tolerance and growth expectations. one thing is certain in crypto, things can get crazy quick. i try to be ahead of this craziness.

but i also think in sei’s case we’re nowhere near a cycle top. that’s a mistake i made last cycle not realizing how early we actually are in a new powerful narrative as ct is ultimately an echo chamber. and if they aren’t even talking about something yet in the mainstream media you can’t possibly say the top is in. still early. still long. nfa.

will graciously take the l if ansem top ticked this one. i’ll respectfully (he’s been very sharp) take the other side and say we go higher across the entire sei ecosystem.🫡",2024-01-04 19:56:00,False,355,38,74,2024,BTC,neutral,0.30070695,0.13481772,0.5644753

here are a couple of quick examples:
anatoly went from claiming $eth should become a layer 2 for $sol, to asserting that $sol is already layer 2 for $eth.

mert, who is a solana dev and appears to be a top influencer for it,  does not understand basic principles about crypto and aggressively responds to posts with double standard takes and ad hominem attacks.

neither of them could give a straight answer about what solana's historical tps record is. sol's maximum tps was seen during the last bull cycle when it was processing about 6.5k tps at moments. however, that includes both execution and consensus trxs. i asked mert what he thought the ""consensus overhead"" was during those peaks, but he responded by saying he had no idea about what meant by ""consensus overhead"". 

mert also suggested that eth rollups will be more attractive if deployed on top of new parallelized evm l1s like monad (even though they are designed to have plenty of headroom on l1 and only a minute fraction of eth's network effects).

7230,14219,Nick,"just discovered a huge meme tokens farm on @solana that makes thousands $sol per day, here's some investigation and proofs 👇 (not a classical liquidity rug pull)

it was 2am, i was poking at @jito_sol bundle explorer and randomly found a very interesting bundle containing transactions in the following sequencing:
- create liquidity pool on raydium for meme token
- buy meme tokens for x $sol from account a
- buy meme tokens for y $sol from account b
- buy meme tokens for z $sol from account c
- send jito tip

so basically, this user launches a token, adds liquidity, and get first 3 buys, user always buys first and always gets the lowest price, since suspect uses jito bundles that has the following gurantees:
- transactions in a bundle and they are guaranteed to execute in order
- bundles execute atomically within the same slot
- bundles can only contain successful transactions. if any transaction in a bundle fails, no transactions in the bundle will make it on-chain

some bundle proofs:
https://t.co/oat7gaidbt (he made >300 $sol profit from this one)
https://t.co/caauz4at59
https://t.co/xkvd8tutog

it was hard to find out how many tokens were created by this farm, but i've randomly pasted one of their wallets in one of the tg channels that monitors new pools and i was shocked(see video in next tweet), he launches tokens every 10 minutes(!). every of them has a twitter, telegram channel, website, unique logo, description and so on. every token looked like a complete conveyor belt.
here's examples of such tokens:
https://t.co/y8oia4adm5
https://t.co/obdlsdymy7
https://t.co/0xbsxiva89

why do i think same person created all meme tokens of this kind?
- all tokens share the same pattern
- same wallets are always the first buyers and top holders
- wallets doesn't spam any other tokens
- no classical liquidity rug pull, but more sophisticated selling
- high jito bundle price, he definitely doesn't want anyone else to win the auction

what i didn't understood is the why he uses cpi in his custom on chain program to perform raydium swap in buy transactions. last instruction invokes program gzheu1bn5gvtpthfgg7m97h4mbxaspfaj9kcplwfbbfs which invokes raydium amm program.  here's tx example: https://t.co/jdpslekjvz
(please lmk if you know why)

(bookmark this)

with the help of solana builders and power users, we've created a fast, easy way to trade on-chain:

- live position updates (no manual refresh)
- best token prices with jupiter routing
- buy new tokens on raydium amm
and more.

⚡️early trading pairs 
our custom router lets you get into newly launched tokens early.

we have integrated with @raydiumprotocol which covers >85% of new token pairs.

integrations with other amms are coming soon.

🪐jupiter integration
shuriken is powered by @jupiterexchange - the leading solana dex aggregator.

shuriken will quote and preferentially route trades through jupiter to obtain the best token prices.
🔄live position updates
we want to accelerate adoption of crypto ecosystems by making on-chain trading as simple as possible.

we've taken on user feedback to rebuild our tg bot from the ground up. to be faster and more intuitive.

this includes tracking and managing all active positions in one convenient place.

these positions update in real time, without the need to manually refresh.
🌟rewards
we've built shuriken stars, one of the most innovative points system to reward true users of our platform.

our solana launch marks the conclusion of season 1.

you can get a head start to season 2 by trading and referring users to our solana bot. more details soon.
👇how to get started
access to shuriken's @solana bot will be initially limited.

spots will be given on a first-come, first-serve basis. you will need to place a trade, to secure your spot.

this is to ensure smooth onboarding of new users. new spots will be added as we increase server capacity.

solana is 3800x faster than ethereum, 10,000x faster than bitcoin

w/ fees @ pennie's or lower

step 1: download a solana wallet, the most used are phantom(https://t.co/uaxgghvbuz) or solflare(https://t.co/osahok2mj9)

step 2: fund your wallet, you can do this from a cex such as coinbase or binance, or through a bridge like allbridge(https://t.co/haebq6lkx2) if you have funds on a different blockchain

step 3: decide what you want to do onchain, solana is ripe with active development in many areas, here are a few:

-staking/validating (@jito_sol, @marinadefinance, @marginfi)
-nfts (@magiceden)
-trading(@jupiterexchange)

step 4: find your community, there are plenty of people exploring and building on solana, either on x or telegram. 

be weary of people who are getting paid for promo or using their followers for exit liquidity. if someone is shilling a new ticker every hour and the chart(https://t.co/gczx8aodaz) goes down immediately after, stay away. 

always make sure you are checking urls and transactions before you interact to avoid any malicious activity.

i have very high conviction in @tensor_hq being a tremendous cook, and rumor has it they time their $tnsr launch with @jupiterexchange for max solana liquidity injection [could be wrong]

while solmaps got nerfed by 75%, they could still be the most +ev play. price still somewhat stable, volume still sky-high, 0 royalties

apart from that, focus on:

- low royalty fees
- top 20-30 collections / high volume
- 'price stable' collections

e.g. the parcl nft might be a good candidate to farm tensor points, crossing off all boxes.

i'm staking a tensorian, so my ref gives you 5% bonus points in perpetuity: https://t.co/kiun5pceuh
----------------------

i also have a good feeling towards @polyhedrazk and @wormholecrypto. the former is quite controversial; my conviction is entirely based off intuition. okx campaign has  ≈30k participants – sounds familiar?

can't go wrong with other interoperability solutions either: layerzero, jumper, debridge, bungee, maybe orbiter

there's definitely market-wide demand for them given recent across and connext price action.

sure, @layerzero_labs is the most botted and farmed airdrop since inception  [closely tailing behind zksync], but it's still rather easy to push into top 300k by simply being consistent, hitting a lot of s/d chains, and pushing volume.

and layerzero might unironically launch at +20b fdv, so there's plenty of governance power to be distributed.

7567,14593,jay,"solana is coming for enterprise with token extensions

token extensions allow customization around the spl token standard:

- privacy features (don’t show amt, sender, etc)
- if-this-then-that logic (e.g. automatically forward 5% of the txn value to this address)
- revoke capabilities (allows a given signer to revert any txn involving said token)

as a manlet myself, i'm loving solana's execution and strategy: 

- monolithic (own the whole stack) set up allows them to move extremely fast and coordinated
- strong bd team allows them to form partnerships and solicit feedback from tech giants such as visa / shopify
- eng team actually ships and delivers on features that address needs and pain points

it's clear they are pushing their advantages hard to carve out a niche and moat that other blockchains can't compete with as effectively

the last piece here is to get a well known enterprise user (such as shopify) to adopt token extensions and make it crystal clear how much $ they save - solana txns are much cheaper than merchant credit card fees

""a night of regret""

the glow of the beer museum sign flickered overhead as we watched her from the shadows, a dame with trouble written all over her face. she stepped out into the misty night, her silhouette framed by the dim glow of the streetlight.

the air was thick with the scent of regret and spilled beer. she lit a cigarette, the flame casting a brief, fiery glow on her face, revealing eyes that had seen too much and lips that whispered secrets.

we approached her in the alley, the echoes of her breakup still lingering in the air like the last note of a sad jazz tune. she glanced our way, the haze of smoke adding an air of mystery to her sorrow.

""bad night to drown my sorrows,"" she muttered, taking a drag and exhaling a cloud of smoke. we nodded, silently understanding that sometimes, in this city of broken dreams, the only solace one could find was in the bottom of a glass or the end of a cigarette.

slap this reminder to cook with us
👇👇👇👇👇👇👇 
https://t.co/5jec9n66hf

we have a sizzler of a sunday with another goliath of #sol. this week we are featuring @dogwifcoin $wif. this project has absolutely melted faces and led the #solona charge recently. with a multi-hundo million mc and one of the best communities in the space, we are definitely #wif it! join us to find out why we think this is the next billion dollar project on the solana ecosystem.

next up to bat is a project we loved since the beginning. @myracoinonsol $myra has been absolutely ripping since we had them on the show. we told you before it hit a million that this was on our radar. this project has since went multi-millions and is showing that she wants her space at the table with #myro. 

it’s been a while since we’ve had our friends on @pepecommunity_ $pepe from #eth on and we are pumped to have a 2x pepe #space. the “people’s pepe” went to 60 million months ago and has been steadily building as we enter the bull. join us for an update on this top project of 2023.

we couldn’t miss an opportunity to unite @solanapepecoin $pepe with pepe on #ethereum. #pepe on solana have absolutely been snapping necks this week and headlined our thursday show. we are so proud of this community that we helped pioneer since the beginning. join us to enjoy a double dose of pepe.

we are pumped to have @op_cateth $opcat on the show. op_cat was originally part of satoshi’s code for bitcoin. it was removed in 2010 due to security concerns, but with current developments may be revived in an effort to make #btc more scalable and open up things for l2s and inscriptions on the chain. join us to find out what these quantum cats are up to!

next up is a very perculiar project. @nobodyelonerc20 $nobody was one of two projects that resurrected recently out of no where. we saw $troll go to the hundreds of millions in marketcap and the other one $nobody was following until a rogue mod of their telegram caused massive fear. since then, the leader of #troll helped recover the tg and is now helping #nobody as a sister project of troll. join us as this story unfolds for this elon narrative.

you guys already know the mighty @satellitedoge1x #doge1 project. they stopped by at a few hundred thousand marketcap and absolutely exploded. this project has reached the multimillion mc and has it’s eyes set to the heavens as the doge-1 space launch grows closer. come check the guys out as we chop it up and get excited about this red hot elon narrative.

@marvinoneth $marvin is a project we definitely have a soft spot for. after a very promising start, their dev stunted momentum by abandoning the project and telegram. since the. the community has dug in to build something real and continues to support in a big way. don’t fade a community that doesn’t quit.

we introduced @blackrocketerc $v69 on our show on thursday. this microcap with cypherpunk meets aeon flux vibes continue to build. we are pumped to see what this project is capable of as it’s first week of life concludes. join us to see what these guys are doing and a update on their growth.

our “lucky last”project is @sbwmickeyerc $mickey has absolutely been a mainstay on #eth this january.  as ip rights for steamboat willy’s variation of mickey became public domain, this defi project became the first entity not named disney to use this classic cartoon. they have since built an amazing community and continue to stay relevant in the trends. our “lucky lasts” have uncanny good luck if you check our episode backlog @k1dandwalt. we expect #mickey to continue that trend.

a gamestop memecoin on @solana, using the same $gme ticker, is trying to repeat the feat, running up to over $14 million in market capitalization within the first 24 hours.

what happened: 
a solana-based gamestop memecoin catapulted to a peak market capitalization of over $14 million within 24 hours of its launch.

on its website wallstsucks . lol, the memecoin bills itself with the slogan ""wall st. can't stop it now"" and makes the direct connection that ""$gme on solana is a tribute to the gamestop saga.""

the token exploded after its launch but lost over 85% of its value after its x profile was banned. 

it has since recovered to a market cap of around $6.5 million and secured a listing on the centralized cryptocurrency exchange poloniex.

why it matters: 
the $gme memecoin follows the recent trend of fast-moving solana memecoins surging to astronomical valuations in no time.

it's remarkable how the $alph team is in stealth mode pioneering features that would be considered groundbreaking in established layer 1 (l1) protocols like ethereum, cardano or solana.

the introduction of 'gasless transactions' is a paradigm shift. this breakthrough is revolutionary, offering developers the means to create web3 applications that provide a seamless, web2-like user experience. 

it eliminates a significant barrier for average users ('normies'), who will no longer need to grapple with even the minimal gas fees currently required. by allowing developers to absorb these costs, alephium is paving the way for a more inclusive and user-friendly blockchain ecosystem. this feature is a game-changer in its own right, adding to alephium's already impressive suite of functionalities. 

the trajectory of the $alph team is not just incremental; it's transformative. they're charting a course that extends well beyond the capabilities of other l1 protocols. 

at this rate, alephium is quietly positioning itself at the forefront of blockchain innovation, setting a pace that others will struggle to match, let alone maintain. 

@alephium is 'for now' the best kept secret in crypto 🤫

7795,14839,Rex St. John,"intro to stake-weighted qos (quality-of-service) in  @solana 

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

stake-weighed qos (quality-of-service) is an implementation feature which, when enabled, allows leaders (block producers) to identify and prioritize transactions proxied through a staked validator as an additional sybil resistance mechanism.

proof-of-stake (pos) networks use the signaling mechanism of stake (funds dedicated to a validator) as a signal of the quality of that validator (thus the term quality of service), helping to prioritize it's transactions for block inclusion. 

unlike validator nodes (aka consensus nodes, voting nodes, staked nodes), rpc nodes (aka unstaked nodes, non-voting nodes) don't gain the benefits associated with stake-weighting when it comes to transaction priority by way of a leader's tpu (transaction processing unit).

with stake-weighted qos, validator nodes can extend a ""virtual stake"" to their rpc node peers (provided that validators have added a ""--staked-nodes-overrides"" stake_map and peer rpc nodes have implemented ""--public-tpu-forwards-address <ip_address_of_validator>""). 

this enables transactions from rpc nodes to get bossed up. swqos provides stake-weighted priority to 80% of a leader's tpu capacity. 

such ""peering arrangements"" can be formed by operators who are running both validator and rpc nodes manually through configuration settings. it is expected that exchanges might also find this feature useful to implement as they often operate both rpc and validator nodes.

one potential benefit of implementing stake-weighted qos could be realized if certain agreements between validators and rpc nodes are in place. rpc nodes may land more transactions in blocks by agreeing to peer with validators, and validators may sell more capacity to rpc nodes. these agreements must be made directly between rpc operators and validators (in meatspace, afk).

with stake-weighted qos enabled, a node holding 1% stake will have the right to transmit *up to* 1% of the packets to the leader. in this way, nodes with higher stake are guaranteed to receive higher quality of service which prevents lower-quality nodes (with less at stake) from maliciously flooding out these transactions, increasing overall sybil resistance.

forgive me if i got a few details wrong, still in my solana ramping process here @anza_xyz :)

built on the solana blockchain, $chat is an innovative communication protocol that offers a full range of functionality, similar to traditional web2 platforms but within the web3 environment.

these features include text 📱 , audio 🎙 , and video 🎥 conversations.

messages and group discussions are safely kept on-chain using solana's cheap gas prices. encrypted communications put privacy first, and webrtc collaborative audio/video convos reinforce security protocols.

they have a fantastic roadmap with five phases that are being developed gradually as time goes on. phase 3 is almost halfway completed. the team has made such rapid progress that @aeyakovenko himself has expressed interest in them.

this is a first mover initiative that has never been done before, so i would definitely keep an eye on it. there are still further developments to come, such as many more cex's coming, launching the solchat app on the solana mobile dapp store, and launching staking for rewards inside solchat.

7940,14996,BillionAireSon 🛡️,"how to succeed trading shitcoins: a beginner's guide.

you won't miss the $bome & $wif on solana if you do all

@noteezzy made a little long tweet on how to degen, which is very helpful, and i took my time to create a guide for newbies. 

1. don't fade strength

usually, when a chart looks bullish, there is a good reason for it. you don't want to fade a bullish looking chart because it was cheaper an hour ago. you can wait for a retracement or enter and dca down but don't completely fade. 

2. understand capital utilisation

the larger the market cap of a shitcoin, the more position or % of the token you should be holding

3. volume is an act of value

you need to understand how well dips are eaten up when looking for reversals on dumps. you want to factor in its historical volume. if you are trading new pairs, you also want to be looking at the current volume. 

4. take profits

considering the volatility of shitcoins, it's prudent to secure profits and at least recoup your initial investment within the first 2-4x gain. you can sell gradually as the price increases or based on chart signals of invalidation. having a solid plan is essential.

5. record or take note of everything

to accelerate your progress, document everything in a journal and spreadsheet. use the spreadsheet to monitor your trades and the journal to note your emotions, reasons for trading, and key insights gained.

6. be comfortable with losses

initially, expect to incur losses as you begin trading. accept this reality and proceed cautiously. if you feel anxious about a trade, it's likely that you've allocated too much capital.

7. trade less but research more

as you begin, avoid entering multiple trades simultaneously. instead, proceed gradually and allocate more time to observing the price action of shitcoins. this process cultivates valuable experience and intuition, which are essential for success.

8. the missor 

it's impossible to catch every mooning opportunity. it's acceptable to miss out sometimes. i've made regrettable trades in the past by succumbing to revenge trading or fomo after missing out. learn from my mistakes and avoid repeating them. 

9. low volume weekends

on weekends (especially sunday), volume is usually pretty low, so if you want to take a break, weekends are probably something to note. 

10. find your expertise or what you love to do

avoid attempting to do everything at once. overextending yourself will likely lead to financial losses. instead, focus on learning, and you'll discover that you excel in one specific type of play or strategy.

work with what you are good at. there are many ways to make it in shitcoins. you don't have to learn all of them. just learn one strategy well. 

11. tools to use

most importantly, get a telegram bot and sniper and a contract checker.  

12. dca down

you don't have to ape all your bags at once. you can always dca down while chart dumps. dca won't work every time, but it is important and for a better entry.

13. take profits out. the most out of crypto

once you've made substantial profits, consider withdrawing some funds to improve your quality of life. many people suffer losses because they reinvest their profits into larger trades, leading to eventual losses.

14. understanding liquidity ratio to marketcap

consider the liquidity of a token relative to its market capitalization. tokens with higher liquidity require more capital to push the price up. having substantial liquidity is advantageous for entering trades with significant positions, as it minimizes slippage. conversely, lower liquidity translates to lower trading volume.",2024-03-16 21:20:00,False,458,160,66,2024,BTC,neutral,0.27533928,0.17196396,0.5526967

8000,15058,mert | helius | hSOL,"ok seeing a lot of confusion on solana txns and fees still

if your txns aren't confirming, there are a few reasons for this:

i) you didn't add fees

ii) even if you did add fees, the current solana client is buggy and **a higher fee might not guarantee that your transaction lands**

read that again ^

iii) due to the randomness inherent in continuous block building and jittery networking / scheduling implementations — even if you increased your fee 10x, it still might not make it, very very important to understand

so don't increase your fee 10x, you just need to be above median, which is generally super low

""if i add higher fee i will be accepted faster"" is not a correct way of thinking about this

iv) this is being largely addressed in solana 1.18 (should be going live around april 1st)

v) during very high congestion periods, leaders might start shedding public rpc connections and start prioritizing staked connections — most of you shouldn't actually need this unless you are very sensitive on confirmation times (we've found this can reduce confirmation times by about 4-5x in prod and have a staked validator service for very serious users)

vi) you can experiment with durable nonces if you don't need instant finality 

vii) finally, we come to ""it's the rpc's fault""

when is it the rpc's fault? well, if the geo-distribution of the rpcs is poor and you didn't add fees, you might get blockhash expired errors since speed to block leader matters

(also if the retry queue is flooded)

we have an open source txn-sender that can help you with this if you wanna play around (we've noticed that we get much lower confirmation times than other rpc providers):  https://t.co/mowh3tvx0u

8002,15060,SolChat,"a) on solana, we store data in program derived addresses (pdas). for each conversation, we create two pdas: one for the sender and one for the receiver. each party can send messages to their respective pdas. we use aes encryption to secure these messages and store the hashes on the blockchain. when a user connects to our ui, the messages are decrypted using an api. we store timestamps for each message and fetch the entire conversation in sequence.
b) indeed, fetching incoming and outgoing messages separately and merging them on the frontend is standard practice.
c) we enable solana wallets to communicate with each other via voice or video using webrtc. we use livekit, a webrtc service that includes a turn server (https://t.co/idcojwrooj). apologies for the confusion; it's turn, not tune.
d) we employ a similar method to store images on ipfs as we do with messages. the images are public, but we store the content identifiers (cids) as hashes on the blockchain.

this is my prediction for the solana and ethereum market cap battle in 2024.

the narrative of sol flipping eth will take over x and sol will pump hard.

this narrative does not need to be true, it just needs to exist for it to affect price.

however, i don’t necessarily want it to be the eth killer nor care about this.

even if there is a 30% chance of sol being the eth killer, this will be bullish.

the power of narratives and fomo is real, but narratives don’t need to be.

we will start to see this more and more on our timelines: “ sol will flip eth”.

well, we’re going to give it another big spark.

cryptoslam will be launching our first ever nft collection, and we have chosen @solana to be its home.

as the source for truth in nfts, our powerful data has been reported on by the world economic forum, bloomberg, cnn, and financial institutions around the world.

over the next few weeks cryptoslam is set to ⚡️shock⚡️ this space with our latest blockchain data innovations.

our nft collection will allow access to a multi-chain preseason event, and next week we will begin announcing our exclusive preseason partner projects who will get first access to the collection.

stay tuned for more announcements over the coming weeks with details about our nft collection, along with a secret perk for nft holders that our partners at @magiceden teased in their announcement of their new (fantastic) multi-chain wallet.

for now, we're ready to build momentum, charge up that spark, and give this space a big jolt of lightning.

1. ckb is the home for universal applications that can interact natively with existing wallets + keys from #bitcoin,  #ethereum, #solana, #cardano etc. other chains cannot do this.

2. ckb is tied directly to state occupation. there is a natural demand driver for ckb: 1 byte of data stored on chain requires 1 ckb to be locked away. as adoption continues, more ckb is taken out of circulation.

3. ckb is future proof. because it is cryptoagnostic, it isn't tied to one standard. it can adopt the newest standards easily. ckb can already implement quantum resistant protocols, or the latest faceid standards supported by apple/google, or pretty much anything. this makes it best suited for mass adoption and long term relevance in the market.

8159,15220,Civic,"civic pass is now integrated with @solana token extensions.

in case you’re not familiar with token extensions, they imbue tokens with a brand new set of features through some technical advancements.

one of these features is called a transfer hook, and it allows advanced permissioning to follow a token.

using transfer hooks, we integrated civic pass with token extensions.

this means that identity credentials can now be referenced by a token along its journey through the ecosystem.

information such as a location, age, humanity and government-issued id may be used to control the token’s transfer rules via civic pass.

this unlocks all sorts of new possibilities for builders.

here are examples of how civic pass x token extensions can be used:

rwas. issuers can ensure that only accredited investors can hold tokens.
unconditional basic income (ubi) tokens. these social change tokens can be protected with sybil resistance.
live events. airdrops, mints and dao token issuances can be simplified. no more need to write smart contracts to protect against bots.

exciting, right? this is just the start.

let us know what you’re building with token extensions. we’d love to collaborate.

dont sell your $sol early, #sol is the king-maker trade this cycle.

(not ironically, i do mean frens)

#solana fans might think this is a cheap shill. it's not. for real. read this carefully.

🚨 if i were #sol hodler i'd be moving my funds to #avalanche right now. even if just temporarily, you can return to solana later.

reasons:

1. check the latest solana blocks (link in replies). they're 99% failed tx's. this is a major red flag. i've no idea what it means tbh, never seen this in any other chain.

2. $sol is currently 4x #avax price, you exchange 4 to 1, so you're not at a disadvantage

this isn't financial advice, it is technical advice

again, donno how to convince you this isn't a cheap shot at #sol. it's not. there's some tech issue with sol rn, some 90+ % of latest blocks are failed txs and i would be bridging to avalanche rn if i were you. 

you can always return later. also, financially, it's 4:1 advantageous to sol hodlers rn, so this isn't greedy advice.

no need to disclaim i'm a #avax fan and this is biased, but being 100% honest, this is exactly what i'd be doing right now bridging to solana if i saw those blocks on $avax explorer.

8266,15331,Robert Sasu,"sovereignchains at the power x.

a complete interoperability layer between #multiversx and all the prominent ecosystems. technically speaking sovereigchains will become l2s on bitcoin, ethereum, and will create bridgeless connections to solana, cosmos (ibc, zkibc) and others. complex settlements being done in towards the connected chains.

but this will be more, and the hint here is our ability to run multiple vms in parallel in the same sovereignchain with direct composable actions between executors, all leveraging a higher module. we also have the examples with evm already working.

a well designed architecture, where you can run, launch and interoperate between multiple vms, deploying any dapp for any language. furthermore, it also means interoperability between tokens as well.

imagine deploying products from evm/svm/cosmos/other chains on a sovereignchain and have those interact with already existing and new products from the multiversx ecosystem. be it tokens, nfts, socialfi, games, defi.

can’t wait to share more specs with a link on agora. early next week.

tomorrow begins an exciting new chaper in the @killabearsnft saga! 

the day we take our first step toward expanding our onchain presence, by opening the bridge that will send our beloved killacubs to the solana network.

dr. fomo and agent 827, will be leading the charge on a mission to explore the vast expanse of planet sol.

to join them on this thrilling journey, you'll need to get your solana wallet ready for action. (you can use any wallet, but we recommend phantom)

how to set up your phantom wallet 👻

1️⃣  install the phantom wallet browser extension

visit the official phantom wallet website (https://t.co/sjsxonxwsm) and click on the ""download"" button. choose the browser extension that corresponds to your preferred web browser (chrome, firefox, or brave). follow the installation instructions provided by your browser.

2️⃣ create your phantom wallet account

once the extension is installed, click on the phantom wallet icon in your browser's toolbar. click on ""create new account"" and follow the prompts to set up your wallet. make sure to securely store your secret recovery phrase, as it will be needed to restore your wallet in case of any issues.

3️⃣ fund your phantom wallet

to bridge your killacubs to solana, you'll need to have some sol (solana's native token) in your phantom wallet to cover transaction fees. 

you can swap eth for sol using synapse: https://t.co/40ymjkxota

simply connect your eth wallet and your new phantom wallet and swap eth to sol

alternatively, you can purchase sol on various cryptocurrency exchanges and then transfer it to your phantom wallet address.

4️⃣ get ready for the galactic portal opening

with your phantom wallet set up and funded, you'll be ready to bridge your killacubs when the galactic portal opens tomorrow. you will have two options:

by following these steps, you'll be prepared to join dr. fomo and agent 827 on their mission to planet sol. stay tuned for more updates on the galactic portal opening and get ready to bridge your killacubs to solana!

the galactic portal opens tomorrow! 🌌 

with your phantom wallet primed and ready, you'll be set to bridge your killacubs when the galactic portal opens. 

bridge: simply bridge your killacubs (and soon killabears!) to solana and explore this new world as you choose.

staking (coming soon): soon you'll also have the opportunity to stake your cubs and bears to participate in the ongoing spacesaga adventures. 

by staking, you'll also be eligible to win one of the coveted killabears or killacubs hidden within the spacesaga rewards vault!

the spacesaga vault currently holds 25 killabears and 35 killacubs! 

more info on staking will be released soon.

bridging your killacubs 🧸

when the galactic portal opens, follow these steps to bridge your killacubs to solana:

connect your phantom wallet to the killacubs bridging platform. this will be on the official https://t.co/lo7xdlfz6r website. do not connect to anything that is not the official site.

select the killacubs you wish to bridge from your collection.

confirm the transaction and pay the associated fees.

once the transaction is complete, your killacubs will be ready to explore planet sol!

the future of @killabearsnft & @killacubsnft on solana 🪐

expanding our ecosystem to @solana opens up a world of possibilities. not only will you be able to buy, sell & trade your nfts on a new blockchain, but you'll also have access to the vibrant solana ecosystem.

there are many things we’ve wanted to build, but were handcuffed by the speed and transaction costs of the ethereum blockchain.

on solana there are virtually no limits. we are finally able to bring our full-scale gaming experience to the ecosystem and community on both desktop and mobile. 

we’ve hired an additional full-time developer to continue increasing our speed, and ability to build innovative products and experiences.

we are working closely with the @solanamobile team to roll out our most successful games on the saga mobile dapp store. by having our killabears and killacubs available on solana, this puts every single player of any of our games within just a few taps of entering the killaverse!

this important first step leads us to a world of opportunity.

we believe in a multichain future, and for you to have the ultimate flexibility to buy, sell, trade, and interact with your assets. and it’s no secret solana is the fastest growing network, and proving to be the choice for teams who are building for mass market audiences.

we are excited to be able to provide this opportunity for you. the team has been working around the clock to put everything into place so your experience with the bridge is smooth and easy.

solana is going to have and needs to have l2s and/or rollups.

i don't think these will manifest exactly like the ethereum ecosystem, but there will always be app builders at scale that want more tps, less competition for blockspace, lower fees, and that want to own more of the aggregate economics that their business generates.

it is insane that drip paid $10,000 in on-chain fees last week plus a plethora of other costs at the rpc level and in our cloud, not to mention the time rewriting our backend.

this is not a complaint, just an incentive-alignment problem that i'm not sure how to address at the base layer: the very apps that bring traffic and customers to the chain are rewarded with increased infra cost when the token appreciates in value, in part due to their efforts.

i think many app builders will be happy to make calculated decentralization tradeoffs to have favorable economics and tps. and for users that want it, being able to pay extra to optionally secure their assets at the base layer makes tons of sense.
