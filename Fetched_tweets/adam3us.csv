The Stasi dared not even dream of what the Himes amendment provides. The language of the statute, which can force those who have ""𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 to equipment that is being 𝗼𝗿 𝗺𝗮𝘆 𝗯𝗲 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 to transmit or store communications"" to spy on behalf of the state, could place a hand on the communications of not merely anyone in Germany (how parochial!), but of nearly everyone on Earth.

110,Stack Hodler,"The Yen carry trade is blowing up in front of us and #Bitcoin is trading above $71,000  Few understand this (mainly because it's nerdy as hell)  But it's a big deal.  And every investor should at least kind of get it to grasp what's really going on with their portfolio.  In simple terms: Japan has kept interest rates artificially super low for over a decade.   Even lower than the US and Europe.  That forced Japanese investors to invest overseas to seek better returns.  Over $3 Trillion found its way into overseas markets, pumping up asset prices and keeping US and EU borrowing costs artificially low as they happily deficit spent.  What were the Japanese investors buying?  Mainly US and European bonds to get better yields than they could get at home.  But since they live in Japan, they care about their returns in Yen terms - not dollar or euro terms.  So they had to hedge their foreign investments to protect themselves in the case of currency volatility.  Why?  Because if you buy a European bond and the Euro suddenly crashes vs the Yen, you could end up losing in Yen terms.  So you buy some insurance for that scenario and pay a premium to protect against that risk.  That works fine until Yen volatility increases.  Which is exactly what is happening now:  As currency volatility increases, the insurance to protect against it gets more expensive.  The insurance starts to eat into the returns you could get by holding US and EU bonds.  So what do you do?   You sell the foreign bonds when they no longer earn you more than holding a Japanese bond.  And if the Japanese bond yields are rising, then that also increases their relative attractiveness.  Which is ALSO happening now, and needs to happen even more to protect the Yen from devaluing too much.  Japanese bond yields are surging towards decade+ highs as I type this:  This is why people care about the Yen and Japanese government bonds.  When Yen volatility rises and Japanese government bond yields rise, investment capital flows out of US and EU bonds and back into Japan.  When investment capital flows out of US and EU bonds, then US and EU bond yields rise.  When those yields rise, highly indebted governments (like the US) start to look even more insolvent than they already look.  Why?  Because higher yields mean higher interest payments on the debt in the near future.  And considering the US is already deficit spending trillions of dollars, those interest payments can only be paid with more borrowed money.  Borrowing more money increases the bond supply, which sends yields even higher.   Which increases the interest payments further, and increases the need for the government to borrow.  Starting to make sense? It's a vicious feedback loop.  So what's the solution?   There's only one solution: When debt becomes impossible to pay in real terms, governments debase their currency to pay it in nominal terms.  And that's why this is tied to #Bitcoin   The fact that Bitcoin is rising over $70K as global bond yields once again surge indicates the market understands that higher yields simply means the timeline for currency debasement is accelerating.  It's an open secret that the fiat endgame is massive currency devaluations.  It's already happening (that's why all assets are sitting near highs), but it can accelerate.  It's all a big game of musical chairs, and investors are becoming increasingly aware that there are only 21 million seats.  When a wave of debasement hits, you want to be holding the hardest assets you can find.  And finite Bitcoin is the hardest asset.  With the recent push by BlackRock, it is increasingly perceived as the Ark for the coming fiat flood.  But there's still plenty of room left on the Ark.  So you might want to secure a seat just in case.",04/11/2024 09:48 AM,True,5715,1250,489

449,Marc van der Chijs,"I spent some time analyzing the post-ETF Bitcoin charts today and came up with some rough price predictions for the next 3 months. Currently the ETF inflows lead to a 2% increase in price per day, which is about $1000 per day. Most of the increase is taking place during the settlement period before US market opening.   It seems to me that you can trade that ‘market inefficiency’, but I am not a day trader. More important, I believe you can predict this daily price increase by looking at the inflows that are announced a few hours before that.  At current prices inflows are 10-12 times of newly created BTC, meaning that people have to sell their BTC in order to fill the ETF orders. They will only do that at higher prices, because hardly anybody who looks at this market would think BTC is peaking. Higher prices lead to more FOMO among ETF investors, leading to more demand and even higher prices.  Two other events that will happen in the next 3 months are important: 1) The halving of the BTC mining rewards in mid April. Right now 900 BTC are produced per day, but after that only 450 new coins are mined. This will add to the supply shock and will lead to even higher prices 2) Many financial advisors can only start selling a new ETF after 90 days of trading (to minimize  the risk that an ETF they sell will fail), meaning by early May demand should start picking up even more.  What will this mean for the price? I think we are in uncharted territory here, but I believe an average increase of $1000 per trading day over the next weeks is very likely. After the 2 events above this could even be substantially higher. This means that unless there is a black swan event we will see a new all time high (>$69K) before the halving and we could possibly hit $100K in the next 2-3 months already.",02/15/2024 01:49 AM,True,3208,619,208

We need to be framing #bitcoin exactly like dollars and cents to overcome unit bias.  To do that we need Bits and Sats. Not Bits vs Sats.  1 BTC =1,000,000 bits  1 bit = 100 sats  So a bit is like a dollar and a sat is like a cent.  Or a bit is like a pound and a sat is like a penny.  Instead of something being 30,000 sats (who describes something as 30,000 cents?) it’s 300.00 bits or 300 bits.  24999 sats is 249 bits and 99 sats or 249.99  This is not a new construct. Bits have always been in the protocol.   We need to move away from trying to make people use such large numbers as 100,000,000 or as small as 0.00000001.   @adam3us @TheRealTahinis @jimmysong",02/06/2024 08:14 AM,True,76,22,19

The APs can then sell the new ETF units into the market and make profits, because the ETF is trading at a premium   If the ETF is trading at a discount, the reverse happens. The APs buy ETF units in the market, provide them to the issuer and then receive the underlying assets. The underlying assets are then sold, generating profits, since the product was trading at a discount   Crucially there should be multiple competing APs. This ensures the product can handle large flows and has low tracking error  By only allowing only cash creations and redemptions, much of the benefits of the ETF structure are lost.

Come join us on the bitcoin front—we have a lot to give, yes, but we need you, too.  You see we’re approaching a battle of the ages here. One that will likely involve bank runs, devaluations, and wars in the West. A conflict whose outcomes will certainly impact the lives of our children and many generations after. And for that years’ long struggle our world needs all the help it can get.  I have a lot of sympathy for people suffering from behavioral addictions and general lack of impulse control—I struggle with this still myself. In fact I believe addiction is the dominant challenge of our current era, co-created by the fiat system which drastically reduces the rewards people can earn from deferral of gratification and a virtuous life in general.  But this is not the place to get in the intellectual weeds.   I’m just here to send you, to the best of my ability, a warm invitation to try and clean up your life. I’m here to remind you that the world is worth it, and to valiantly assure you that you are worth it.  So get yourself to a meeting (yes the one you’ve been telling yourself you don’t need), pick up that book you bookmarked a while ago, ask someone for advice or support, cue up that meditation podcast, walk a dog, go on a walk in nature, or take a cold shower for 30 seconds. I suggest beginning small, so small that you can take that first step right now.  We’re all going to die one day. You know it, and deep down you also know what kind of life will make you feel proud to have lived. Sure, you can keep trying to get that chuckle out of other degen traders, and get on a little buzz by setting up that 10x leveraged play, but deep down you know that is just a poor surrogate for making a real connection with yourself and the rest of this world.  Here is the good news: once you start walking the path towards the good life (not as in hedonism but as in doing the right thing), you will, little by little, start noticing that you are in fact not alone, that in fact we are all in this together. You’ll start developing friendships and rekindling old ones that you’d forgotten you lost. And, paradoxically, as you slowly face your fears of “not having enough” head on, you’ll realize you already have so much to be grateful for, and you’ll start to feel happier than you’ve ever been.  Help yourself, you’re worth it! Under that thin cynical veneer, a truly beautiful person resides. That person knows in his bones that this little planet, with all its male and female silliness, with its songs of pain and sorrow, this blue-green-orange place teeming with life, is surely worth it too. Your possible reaction to this paragraph, that “meh…” or eye rolling part of you, that’s not all of you, that’s not who you are deep down. There is wonder in you, and joy, and a thirst for worthwhile adventure. If you can’t feel it, it doesn’t mean the sun isn’t there for you, but just that there’s clouds hanging out in your sky. An ominous sky makes place for a cheerful one, over time but inevitably, once one starts walking the path of the good life.  So join us my friend.

If you want to invest, BUY BITCOIN.",12/13/2023 11:11 PM,False,349,61,35
743,Liquid Network 🌊,"Under the high-fee market, there has been a renewed interest in second layers, resulting in an increased usage and adoption of Liquid 🌊. Many are now leveraging Liquid’s cheap fees and faster one-minute block times to stack cheap sats and HODL in the mid-term, using it as a bridge to Lightning⚡️without having to use the mainchain (see @Boltzhq and @PeerswapLN today).  With that adoption, a number of new users are grappling with understanding the tradeoffs Liquid makes–so we thought we would address some of their questions.  “Liquid is centralized”  Liquid is distributed but is not fully permissionless like #Bitcoin. Today, Liquid is governed by a geographically and geopolitically-distributed federation of more than 65 Bitcoin-centric companies (https://liquid.net/). Within these members are a subset (we call them functionary operators) who run specialized hardware (functionaries). The functionaries propose and sign the blocks that require 2/3rds + 1 (or 11-of-15) of them to approve.  Compromising the Federation's multisig wallet would require commandeering 11 separate functionaries around the world while remaining undetected or for 11-of-15 functionary operators to be dishonest and collude–against their incentives as contributing members of Liquid.🌊🌎   We have plans to increase the number of functionaries with DynaFed, which went live on Liquid in 2022, and with potentially new signature schemes like ROAST, which can help us further Liquid’s overall decentralization without network disruption.  “Why L-BTC? Why a federation?”  Liquid has no separate altcoin, pre-mine or ICO. The native coin of Liquid is BTC! We opt to use a federated two-way peg model (with pegged BTC—called L-BTC—as the underlying coin), which still provides some decentralization and protection from a single point of failure and is more scalable. This is the tradeoff for not wanting to issue a separate Proof-of-Stake (PoS) governance token that we believe would encourage dishonest participation and take away from Bitcoin network effects.   We believe altcoins generally—and more so with premines—inherently create conflicts of interest, distorting participant behavior to gaming other participants. People frequently ask if they can invest in Liquid (they mean to buy a pre-mined token or altcoin), but like Lightning, Liquid has none—the native currency IS BTC. If you want to invest, BUY BITCOIN.  Another reason we chose the federated model is that it did not require any changes to be made to Bitcoin itself, something other layer-2 proposals require first. This not only allowed us to build and experiment without constraints right out the gate but, more importantly, the federated model did not impose any risk to Bitcoin’s own consensus and incentive model.  “Seriously, why the two-way peg though? Aren’t there alternatives?”  There is still no generic approach to delivering trustless, two-way pegged sidechains. Solutions must consider tradeoffs between security, features provided, and the impact they might have on the Bitcoin mainchain. A sidechain that requires coupling to the mainchain may expose the incentives of the mainchain to unknown attack vectors and may lead to remedial soft forks.  A federated peg model may not be as permissionless as other solutions, but it has the benefit of being isolated from Bitcoin in its implementation; plus, the use of strong federations establishes a security profile that is suitable for many applications.  We consider a federated approach to pegged sidechains as a sound alternative to solutions that either require a centralized counterparty, an altcoin, or changes to Bitcoin itself. The increased trust requirements necessitated by the federated model are a risk assumed by sidechain users alone, and place no extra burden on users of the mainchain.  “Fees go to Blockstream”   Blockstream’s role in Liquid is purely as a technical provider to the federation; Liquid’s governance technology board requests software features and fixes for the functionary software and ultimately evaluates whether to adopt any changes.  As the technical provider of Liquid, one of Blockstream’s duties is to maintain the fee wallet; however, the fees ultimately belong to the federation. Blockstream only administers them, burning them as needed for sweeps and peg-outs–the rest remains untouched. The fee wallet is viewable and can be audited here: https://blockstream.info/liquid/address/QLFdUboUPJnUzvsXKu83hUtrQ1DuxyggRg  It’s additionally important to note that the 15 functionaries, not Blockstream, control the bitcoin (11-of-15) multisignature wallet and the wallet can be viewed here: https://blockstream.info/address/bc1qxvay4an52gcghxq5lavact7r6qe9l4laedsazz8fj2ee2cy47tlqff4aj4  “What are Confidential Transactions?”  Liquid's Confidential Transactions (CT) feature blind transaction amounts and asset types. This makes selectively not processing certain transactions difficult as the information to distinguish is hidden and available only to the sender and receiver end to end securely.   We believe the lack of on-chain confidentiality on competing platforms is a major liability for serious investors and companies, allowing for the possibility of front-running that disregards the overall protection of one’s financial privacy.  Longer term, there is some research being done with schemes like Bulletproofs++ (https://blog.blockstream.com/bulletproofs-a-step-towards-fully-anonymous-transactions-with-multiple-asset-types/) that could potentially improve this confidentiality aspect.  We’ve only covered a few key points, but we encourage those who would like to learn more about Liquid’s federated sidechain model, how it can bring new features to Bitcoin, and the tradeoffs it makes to read the post here: https://blog.liquid.net/the-truth-about-liquid/  We also invite you to join us on the Liquid Community Telegram group for any specific questions and for further dialogue, we're happy to have you!: https://t.me/liquid_community",12/13/2023 11:00 PM,True,479,180,47

773,MacroScope,"Last week, I flew from New York's JFK Airport to El Salvador. Here's what happened during my trip.  Because of Bitcoin, I've been reading about the country and decided to visit. More on Bitcoin in a minute. I'll also comment on the topic of safety. First, here's a takeaway from what I saw:  If I was an investor looking internationally for on-the-ground opportunities, I would immediately get an office in the capital, San Salvador, and look for ways to put money in the country -- by either starting a new business and employing Salvadorans, or backing an existing business. Multiple sectors are growing fast including tourism, hospitality and real estate. The opportunities seem huge.  I stayed a week in San Salvador and in El Zonte (""Bitcoin Beach""). The first impression is at the airport, which is modern and efficient. Because of a delay in New York, my flight arrived in El Salvador a few hours late. But my hotel driver was there. He had been patiently keeping watch for me, and he was smiling as he held up a sign with my name on it. This was my introduction to the country, and it turned out to be representative of what I would experience during my visit. The people are friendly, hard working, proud, entrepreneurial, and family-oriented.  You quickly notice that new construction and infrastructure improvements are happening everywhere. I was struck by how the construction workers seemed to be working very hard. You get the sense that this is a country on the move, and it's easy to see why El Salvador's financial situation has improved. The country's sovereign bonds have seen huge returns recently, and institutional investors should continue to watch for opportunities to allocate here.  The goal in El Salvador seems to be a Latin American version of Singapore: business-friendly, growth-oriented, and tough on crime. Based on what I saw during my visit, this is achievable and they are making progress. Remember, Singapore wasn't always the type of country it is now -- far from it, in fact. It first needed the right policies and leadership. And by the way, I don't remember seeing the international media criticize Singapore for being tough on crime.  Regarding safety, I felt totally safe and relaxed at all times in El Salvador -- much safer than even the best areas of New York City these days. The police and private security guards are everywhere and they are professional, courteous, vigilant and tough. You do not want to be a criminal here. But it was not always this way. I had an interesting conversation with a young man working in a small shop. He said before the crackdown on gangs, much of the money he earned had to be paid to the bad guys, so it was almost pointless to own or start a business. I asked him where the gang members are now. His reply: ""Dead or in jail."" During this trip, I developed a special contempt for people in North America and elsewhere who scold other countries for cleaning up crime while their own cities collapse around them.  If there is something to keep an eye on, it's that President Bukele and his ""new ideas"" policies are clearly very important for continued progress. Bukele is hugely popular and viewed by many as a national hero, so it seems assured that the current progress will continue after the upcoming election. El Salvador's continued stability and future prosperity is important for the United States, and as a U.S. citizen I believe we should be doing everything possible to be a strong ally and support the country's current direction.  Regarding Bitcoin, it's part of El Salvador's policy of ""new ideas."" During my visit, I realized that news reports about how much the country has gained or lost on BTC are ridiculous. Bitcoin has more than paid for itself. Without the country's adoption of Bitcoin, I would not have visited, nor would many others. But Bitcoin's benefits are not just about more tourism. It's part of a broader holistic education about computers, technology, finance, and personal growth and independence. (And I think this is a good narrative to use for Bitcoin as its adoption continues to spread globally.) Young people here are learning about Bitcoin. In coming years, they will have the knowledge and skills to get good jobs working for companies or start their own tech-related businesses. The introduction of Bitcoin by Bukele is probably one of the smartest socio-economic moves any country has ever made, and it will continue to pay dividends in various ways for years to come. Other countries should learn from this and do the same.  Regarding young people and education, I toured the new national library in San Salvador, which is very impressive. Afterwards I asked myself: Do we still have the vision and willpower to build these types of public facilities in the US? I wonder about that.  I know this twitter account has many readers who work in the financial sector, especially in New York. I encourage you to put El Salvador on your travel list. You'll find the economic development story interesting (historically, it's rare to be able to witness this type of national transformation as it's happening) and the authenticity is a wonderful change from Wall Street and its favorite vacation spots. You can get a direct flight in the morning and be on the beach or looking at a volcano that afternoon. Before you go, it's important to understand that this is not the Bahamas or the Hamptons (and guys, how many times can you visit those places?). It's unpretentious, raw and organic -- great food and coffee, surfing, and wild natural beauty. As for San Salvador, it's bustling and busy with upscale shopping and restaurants, and big hotels as well as leafy, quieter places to stay.  This was my first visit to Latin America, and I don't speak Spanish, but everyone was smiling and helpful. I gave generous tips to anyone who helped me -- drivers, waiters, hotel staff -- and they were all very grateful. If you go, you should do the same. Be a good visitor. They're trying hard.  As someone who remembers the news headlines about El Salvador going back 40 years, I never imagined myself making this trip, and it felt a bit surreal to be there. But what's happening is not only a national transformation, it's a story about human perseverance and triumph despite a tough history. We should be cheering them on.  I look forward to returning.",12/03/2023 03:25 AM,True,7249,1454,528

801,Peter Van Valkenburgh,"It’s time to have the conversation: Is the Bank Secrecy Act unconstitutional? Beyond the speech and privacy issues, the BSA is a sweeping delegation of law making power. Today we're publishing a new report explaining in detail why that's a problem.  📜Full report is linked in the next tweet, but in a nutshell, the BSA is an incredibly broad law that criminalizes everyday life. As our report explains, breadth rather than ambiguity is the main problem with the statutory text. Take, for example, the money transmission definition:   ""the problem is not that the definition of 'money transmitter' is uncertain. The problem is that, taken seriously, the definition would convert every paid or paying American into a 'financial institution' and obligate each of us to register with the federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as such, keep extensive records of all transactions, robustly identify all transactional counterparties, and regularly report any suspicious dealings we have had with other Americans or foreign persons. And we must do all of that on penalty of felony conviction, severe fines, and jail time.""  That's just the plain language interpretation of the relevant provisions. In practice that absurd breadth gets narrowed by regulatory opinion and the courts:  ""In actual practice no one reads the definition of financial institution as encompassing every paid or paying American. Instead, ambiguity in the definition is invented as a remedy to the statute’s breadth.""  But this selective narrowing contradicts the plain meaning of the text and also enables endless discretion to choose when to enforce the law and when to not. The result is bad for the predictability of the law and bad for fair and evenhanded enforcement. It raises topical jurisprudential questions involving the major questions doctrine and whether the Court should apply substantive canons of construction like lenity or constitutional avoidance. As judges faced with these issues have said:  ""Although this court, like all other institutions of the United States, is supportive of the law enforcement goals of the government and society, we cannot engage in unprincipled interpretation of the law, lest we foment lawlessness instead of compliance.""  By looking through rulemakings and congressional hearings across the last 30 years we come to a startling conclusion: the statute doesn't actually give the Treasury the authority it has used to selectively narrow the definition through interpretation. Instead, and even more problematically from a constitutional separation of powers standpoint, the statute simply delegates a naked power to enforce or not enforce the law to Treasury and does so without any intelligible principle.   ⚖️That brings us to the nondelegation doctrine. As Justice Gorsuch has emphasized in recent opinions, Congress not the executive branch is empowered by our constitution to make laws. As we find in the context of the BSA:   ""Throughout this report we have recounted all the many ways that the Bank Secrecy Act, owing to its incredible breadth, has been interpreted and reinterpreted, expanded and contracted by the courts and by FinCEN. Often these have been good and necessary decisions made to avoid over-application of a dangerously invasive warrantless surveillance regime, to literally prevent our otherwise inevitable drift towards a society where everyone is obligated to spy-on and rat-out everyone else. These are not, however, factual findings. These are not decisions made according to some limiting and sensible criteria set out in the statute. These are policy judgements of serious gravity and they’ve been made by the executive branch with powers unconstitutionally delegated.""  Are you a big con-law nerd?
