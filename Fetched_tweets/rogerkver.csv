25,Colin Talks Crypto ü™ô,"One of the biggest lies that was pushed upon the bitcoin community was that ‚Äúbitcoin can‚Äôt scale without sacrificing decentralization‚Äù.  I see people regurgitating this left and right. This was apparently a highly effective lie.  This lie was pushed by corrupted developers who were paid by Big Banks to stifle Bitcoin. I know it sounds crazy, but it's true. You can see who paid their salaries here (read the entire thread and all supporting links/videos): https://x.com/ColinTCrypto/status/1656500956136189952  This lie was spread intentionally through the use of mass censorship and social media engineering many years ago (much in the same manner that we see heavily employed today on topics such as world politics and health). You can read about this corruption of bitcoin development in the following thread (make sure to scroll down to read the full thread and read/watch all supporting links) here: https://x.com/ColinTCrypto/status/1656500956136189952  The TRUTH is that bitcoin CAN scale, and could always scale, both today and 15 years ago. And if scaled correctly and intelligently, it does NOT lead to centralization in any pragmatically meaningful way. Decentralization is a balance of factors and is not an extreme black-or-white calculation, as the Bitcoin Core devs would have you believe. The devs want you to think that if bitcoin scales at all, then its decentralization is over. This is simply not true. There is a harmonious balance that can be struck.  Satoshi himself was in favor of MASSIVE scaling and detailed this in numerous places. A new email recently surfaced from satoshi which makes this more clear than ever. It was uncovered in a court case (see image below). https://x.com/ColinTCrypto/status/1761523084454977615  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  To all those people who keep parroting the nonsense that ""bitcoin can't scale because it would destroy decentralization"", I urge you to consider this:  There are MANY OPTIMIZATIONS (both that we‚Äôve thought of and new ideas that can be developed) that reduce block size and database size.  There are already a number of technologies that exist, such as ‚Äúpruning‚Äù, SPV wallets, compression, and block propagation technologies. There are technologies such as ‚Äúsmall blocks‚Äù, ‚Äúthin blocks‚Äù and ‚Äúxthin blocks‚Äù, which dramatically reduce bandwidth requirements through block propagation compression enhancements. These can reduce bandwidth by 1/10th or more. These are just SOME angles of optimization and are by no means a comprehensive list.  This is in addition to the natural growth of technology of bandwidth, storage technology and computing power. These have increased at a tremendous rate over the past 15 years, and they will continue to do so.  To those who reply in a defeatist manner that ‚ÄúBitcoin CAN'T scale because it ruins decentralization‚Äù:  Really, all such people are confessing to is a lack of creativity, a lack of technical understanding and a lack of willingness to try. They are the same sheep who believe anything the Core devs spoonfed them, in order to stop innovation and new scaling ideas, for ulterior reasons (again, see entire thread here: https://x.com/ColinTCrypto/status/1656500956136189952)  If one simply had the attitude ‚Äúhow could we pull this off?‚Äù, they would then come to realize it IS possible to scale bitcoin on the base layer. Layer 2 scaling is fine too, but not at the detriment of the base layer. Layer 2 scaling also depends in a large part on a scalable layer 1.  So, the next time you hear some flavor of ""bitcoin scaling isn't possible because it harms decentralization"", show them this thread, because what they are saying is a flat out lie.  Satoshi didn‚Äôt have time to explain it to everyone and I see why.",02/25/2024 08:25 PM,True,303,80,64

72,Colin Talks Crypto ü™ô,"BITCOIN DEVELOPERS ARE EITHER INCOMPETENT OR COMPROMISED. WHICH IS IT?   In response to the below post (which went somewhat viral) about Bitcoin‚Äôs failure to scale being due to it being compromised, there were some individuals (mostly diehard maximalists) which made defensive, retaliatory and attacking comments.   Here‚Äôs how I can prove my statement and it‚Äôs up to you to decide whether Bitcoin‚Äôs poor development is due to 1. incompetence or 2. maliciousnes, and that those are the only two real options.  One common rebuttal (which falls flat on its face, as we will see by the end of this post) is ‚Äúsmall blocks keeps bitcoin decentralized‚Äù. This is an ignorant comment as it is black-and-white logic that does not account for nuance.  Since 2009, Bitcoin‚Äôs scaling hasn‚Äôt even kept up with basic technology growth (bandwidth, cpu, ram, storage space). This isn‚Äôt even accounting for improvements that could have been made within the protocol itself‚Äî we‚Äôre just talking pure, raw hardware and bandwidth improvements in computing technology.  CPU, bandwidth, RAM and storage capacity have all increased *massively* over the past 14 years, yet BTC hasn't taken advantage of these technology increases. Segwit was a meager ~2mb increase, again failing to keep up with current technology speeds.  The point? Bitcoin could at least scale up to what modern technology allows WITHOUT SACRIFICING DECENTRALIZATION.  ‚û°Ô∏è The fact that bitcoin doesn‚Äôt make maximum use of modern technology (cpu, bandwidth, storage, ram) is the mind boggling part and the clue to either: bitcoin dev incompetence or being compromised. ‚¨ÖÔ∏è  Instead of asking ‚ÄúWhat is the magic number?‚Äù (for block size), one should be asking ‚Äúhow can bitcoin keep up with technology in a way that allows it to scale along with the growth of Internet bandwidth, CPU power, memory and storage, over time?‚Äù  #Bitcoin SHOULD be taking advantage of the advances in hardware as well as increasing Internet bandwidth. Yet it stays stagnated and does not, at the cost of a poor user experience.  IMO this is very poor developer planning. I attribute it, not to incompetence (because the developers are all highly intelligent), but much more likely to being compromised.  As a side note: personally wonder what bitcoin‚Äôs value would be if it weren't for these artificially imposed bottlenecks, which are WELL BELOW the current technology and bandwidth limits.  imo BTC‚Äôs price would be MUCH higher if it hadn‚Äôt stagnated and chosen to ignore on-chain scaling.  I think we would have already seen a $100k-$200k per bitcoin, or maybe even more, if it were not for this extremely poor development path.  - - -  So let me ask you: are Bitcoin devs incompetent or compromised (a conflict of interest)? Because there‚Äôs really not any other good answer. We‚Äôve proven here that ‚Äúkeeping the network decentralized‚Äù is itself a fallacy of an argument when bitcoin‚Äôs scaling (or lack there of) doesn‚Äôt even keep up with basic technology growth, and instead falls massively behind. We‚Äôre at 2009-2015 technology levels in the year 2023.  Also note: I am not advocating another coin in this message.
