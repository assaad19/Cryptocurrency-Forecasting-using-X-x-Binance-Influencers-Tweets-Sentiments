29,Nick Neuman,"DON'T LET YOUR BITCOIN DIE WITH YOU 💀 ⚰️  Yea look, nobody likes to admit it but we all have to die one day.   As I've been talking to people about their self custody lately - both Casa members and not - I hear the same thing over and over.  ""What happens if I die?""  Many people feel pretty good about their bitcoin security for themselves. But their family members often have no idea how to use this stuff. Hardware wallet? Seed phrase stamped on metal? Shamir's secret sharing backups using SD cards, a passphrase, and a treasure hunt through the backyard with a shovel? 😵  We're solving that problem for all Casa members, starting today with Casa Inheritance. A key design principle we kept while building this was to make it as simple as possible for Recipients (your family members that will receive your bitcoin if you pass), while maintaining Casa-level security. An estate transfer is already a stressful time for family, and it can become even more stressful if you add in a crazy treasure hunt to access a fortune in bitcoin.  For our basic 3 key vaults, we wanted it to be as easy as using the app. No metal plates, no need to use a hardware wallet, no magic passwords you have to keep track of or else risk messing up the asset transfer. Simplicity is security.  So how does it work, in detail?  A Vault Owner (Casa member) designates a Recipient (their family or friend) in the Casa app. The Recipient receives an invite to create a free Casa account. The Recipient scans a QR code provided by the Vault Owner, which contains an encrypted version of the owner's mobile key. This encrypted key is only able to be imported by the Recipient's Casa account, and the Recipient can't initially use it or see the vault balance.  If the Vault Owner passes away, the Recipient can request access to the vault in their Casa app. This starts a 6 month timer, and sends a ton of notifications every month to the owner. If the owner is still alive, they can reject the request in app. If they are not, the timer will run out. When it does, the Recipient will be able to use the shared mobile key and the request a signature from the Casa Recovery Key for the shared vault. This gives them 2 out of 3 signatures, enough to access the assets.  For 5 key vault users, one hardware key is shared with the Recipient. This small increase in friction for Recipients is often worth it for the increased security and resilience of a 5 key vault for larger holdings.  To summarize now that you have the details: 1. Share keys and vault access during setup 2. 6 month timelock to ensure no malicious theft 3. Use shared keys and Casa key to access assets  Full setup takes less than 5 minutes.  Inheritance is one of the biggest problems in self custody today. If you've hodled through years of painful bear markets, you owe it to yourself and your family to not let the reward for that patience go to zero because you didn't have a plan - and we're here to make that easy.  Check out the video to see how easy it really is.  Like I said earlier this week - Casa is going after major problems in self-custody this year. Check this one off the list ✅. Next one coming sooner than you think 🔥.",03/27/2024 03:01 PM,True,384,86,70

57,danny huuep,"Ordinals is collaborative art on Bitcoin, by many artists all over the world.  Ordinals is art that is of many forms, not just images, but art that uses the Bitcoin blockchain in the art itself. Casey Rodarmor started an art movement on Bitcoin with his original art, the idea and first implementation of Ordinals.   Inscription #0 is his, as well as the launch of the Ordinals website which highlighted the inscription numbers and associated image inscriptions. This led directly to the wave of art as images on Bitcoin with low inscription numbers. The art of being recorded immutably on the timechain and medium of Bitcoin at the earliest time.   Then came art that explored using the medium of Bitcoin in more creative ways. Artists experimented with Recursive Inscriptions, and the art of code. Artists helped evolve Ordinals itself and contributed to the open source code base. Creators created even faster than the protocol allowed or would allow. Creators started their own movements and meta-protocols, like BRC-20, which took the whole Bitcoin blockchain by storm. This would lead to Casey himself to building a competing fungible token protocol called Runes.   Throughout all this, the provenance of art on Bitcoin remained one of the pillars of this art movement. Artists care about the provenance of their works, their collections, and the Parent-Child Provenance feature provided this clear provenance. Not easily visible or browsable in explorers and marketplaces yet, but this feature is standardizing how collections are recorded immutably forever on Bitcoin for future generations to appreciate.  The infrastructure for art on Bitcoin is still being built out, and creating some of the early works required a deep understanding of Bitcoin. These innovative works were possible because of the collaborative nature of many of the artists and builders on Bitcoin, starting with Casey who created his art on Bitcoin as an open source project.",02/25/2024 09:12 PM,True,239,78,35

63,Alan Austin,"Seeing a lot of frustration in replies regarding the price of Litecoin. Comments even suggesting there’s too much focus on “sound money” principles and not enough hype 😑  Has the price of Litecoin been disappointing?  Of course it has. No one feels this as much as those who’ve been working on Litecoin adoption each and every day.  Litecoin is a distributed network that doesn’t have founder coins to manipulate the price or create artificial supply constraints. Unfortunately for those focused specifically on price, the very same qualities that make Litecoin sound money also impact the way price can behave.  As with most assets, price typically catches up with value at some point, but there’s no guarantee as to when that happens, and with some assets price always lags behind.  @LTCFoundation has no control over the price of Litecoin, so we focus on what we can help with: Value, by way of Litecoin development and adoption.  And to this point, almost every metric (with the exception of price) continues to show exceptional growth in terms of activity and usage.  In addition to volunteers, Litecoin Foundation has a small paid staff, most of whom who have accepted much less than they can be making elsewhere, because they are passionate about what they do and believe in the importance of sound money and financial privacy in our lives.  So before pointing the finger at Litecoin Foundation or it’s team because you are frustrated about price, or complaining that the Foundation isn’t doing enough, remember that this is a decentralized movement and ask yourself what you can be doing to help?     Because if you’re relying on any single organization or individual for Litecoin’s success, then you’re missing the point on what it takes for a decentralized project to become successful.  We can do this together.",02/20/2024 09:39 PM,True,185,44,51

101,Omid Malekan 🧙🏽‍♂️,"Some thoughts on the Binance settlement, with the preamble that I think companies that don’t like certain laws should still comply with them while campaigning for change.  One interpretation of the government’s suit and the resulting mammoth settlement is that by refusing to implement compliance schemes like AML & CFT, Binance failed to stop money laundering and the financing of terrorism.  The problem with this interpretation is that vast sums of illicit flows still move through the companies who do comply. Banks, brokers and other types of (mostly non-crypto) intermediaries are the preferred route for tax and sanctions evaders, to the tune of over a trillion dollars a year.  A more accurate interpretation is that Binance refused to participate in the pretense of stopping illicit finance. They didn’t kick out the occasional bad actor or file endless suspicious activity reports. In other words, they didn’t play the game, didn’t pay their annual tithe to the AML-Industrial Complex (a cushy landing spot for ex officials) and didn’t kiss the ring, as it were.  You could see the Kabuki aspect of all this in the joint press conference held by various Important Government Officials yesterday. If you didn’t know the context and watched the whole thing on mute you’d think the Feds just brought down a major drug cartel or rounded up the remnants of ISIS, as opposed to finally extracting their pound of flesh from the preferred trading venue for Dogecoin.   This settlement was so important that it warranted an appearance by the Secretary of the Treasury, but not important enough for her to know how to pronounce the company’s name.  Also telling: most of the Tough Talk from the People in Suits was about the procedures Binance refused to follow, and notably NOT about the terrorism that Binance enabled.   The same goes for the unsealed settlement docs, full of shocking (not really) revelations like the time some dude in Washington traded $1400 worth of some coin with some dude in Iran. This from the same administration that released $10b to the Iranian government a week ago.  People who sincerely believe that crypto is some unique enabler of bad people doing bad things don’t understand how the rest of the financial system actually works.   One of the biggest banks in America still operates a division in Russia, and many of the world’s worst tyrants use America as their piggy bank. But that’s all considered OK because someobody did the paperwork.  Binance was wrong to lie to its customers and wrong for not being compliant. But that doesn’t mean it’s a bad company. Spend five minutes googling “banks facilitating money laundering” and you’ll find that financial firms with household names have been caught doing far worse things involving orders of magnitude more money, yet suffered much milder consequences.  If they’d been held to the Binance Standard there’d be hundreds of managing directors in jail and less money for shareholder buybacks (or lobbying). But the bankers were smart enough to never question the game.  Unlike FTX—a company whose psychopathic leader was beloved by half the people in that press conference not that long ago—Binance didn’t abscond with user money.   It did a reasonably decent job of onboarding tens of millions of poor, brown, and otherwise underprivileged people into the financial system, something the world’s compliant financial firms have chronically failed to do (which is OK—it’s not considered redlining when the AML department holds the pen).  Binance's net contribution to a more inclusive financial system is something to be commended. What remains to be seen is if firms like that can keep serving underserved populations now that they too have agreed to play the game, and do the paperwork.",11/22/2023 04:29 PM,True,1600,433,92
102,CZ 🔶 BNB,"Today, I stepped down as CEO of Binance. Admittedly, it was not easy to let go emotionally. But I know it is the right thing to do. I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself.  Binance is no longer a baby. It is time for me to let it walk and run. I know Binance will continue to grow and excel with the deep bench it has.  I’m pleased to announce that @_RichardTeng, our now former Global Head of Regional Markets, has been named the new CEO of Binance today.  Richard is a highly qualified leader and, with over three decades of financial services and regulatory experience, he will navigate the company through its next period of growth. He will ensure Binance delivers on our next phase of security, transparency, compliance, and growth.  Prior to joining Binance, Richard was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM); Chief Regulatory Officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX); and Director of Corporate Finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  With Richard and the entire team, I’m confident that the best days for @Binance and the crypto industry lay ahead.  As a shareholder and former CEO with historical knowledge of our company, I will remain available to the team to consult as needed, consistent with the framework set out in our U.S. agency resolutions.  What’s next for me?  I will take a break first. I have not had a single day of real (phone off) break for the last 6 and half years.  After that, my current thinking is I will probably do some passive investing, being a minority token/shareholder in startups in areas of blockchain/Web3/DeFi, AI and biotech. I am happy that I will finally have more time to spend looking at DeFi.  I can’t see myself being a CEO driving a startup again. I am content being an one-shot (lucky) entrepreneur. Should there be listeners, I may be open to being a coach/mentor to a small number of upcoming entrepreneurs, privately. If for nothing else, I can at least tell them what not to do.  On that note, I am proud to point out that in our resolutions with the U.S. agencies they:  - do not allege that Binance misappropriated any user funds, and - do not allege that Binance engaged in any market manipulation.  Funds are SAFU!  With that, I look forward to seeing the new leadership take the reins. Please join me in congratulating Richard on his well-deserved promotion.  Onwards!

OCM Dimensions shows how powerful Ordinals can be to create great works on Bitcoin, and future creators can too! 🔥  Some OCM Dimensions highlights: - Pioneering the use of recursion and composability on Bitcoin. - One of the first parent-child collections, inscribed February 2023, with clear on-chain Collection provenance. - Enables compression, and widely used libraries (p5.js, Three.js), all on-chain on Bitcoin for future creators to use. - Incredibly efficient use of block space, less than 1 kilobyte per Dimensions ordinal. - The first 300 are inscribed in a beautifully orchestrated way on Bitcoin, on 300 consecutive satoshis, and ordered on-chain by their satoshi numbers in ascending order, and matching their Dimensions number. - The first 300 are all inscribed on satoshis from early January 2009 (block 78), the third day of Bitcoin. - The first 300 are all “Cursed” inscriptions. - Achieved what is thought impossible on Bitcoin today: a random on-chain reveal *after* mint and after the Dimensions ordinals are immutably inscribed. - High definition, 3D, animated, and interactive art that is all rendered directly from code inscribed on Bitcoin, and can scale up to any resolution automatically to fit the display size. The bigger the display, the more amazing Dimensions become. - A Bitcoin native mint that requires no additional fees from the minter, is non-custodial, prevents front-running (and Mempool sniping), and there’s no rush for the minter.",06/14/2023 10:32 AM,True,479,205,91

233,Jacob Canfield,"Holy shit.   I just got attacked with one of the most complex scams in #crypto that I have seen to date.  Please read if you use @coinbase.   This just happened 15 minutes ago.  THIS IS A WARNING FOR ALL COINBASE USERS!  There has been some sort of a data breach.   First, I received a text message saying that my @coinbase 2FA was changed.  I then received three calls from a @coinbase ""customer support"" that was from a San Fransisco number asking if I was traveling outside of the US and if I requested an email change and a 2FA change. (NOTE: I tried to record this, but couldn't find my wife's phone before they hung up)  I said no to traveling and they said that they cancelled the 2FA and email change request and sent a text to verify it was cancelled.   They then sent me to the 'security' team to verify my account to avoid a 48 hour suspension.   They had my name, my email and my location and sent a 'verification code' email from help@coinbase.com to my personal email.  I told them that I didn't need their assistance and I changed the password already and he told me that it wouldn't work to verify the account and that they would be locking it down for 7 days due to a lack of verification unless I provided the code.  He then got angry and hung up the phone on me after I told him that I wouldn't provide the code.  After the first text, I immediately logged into my #coinbase and changed the password and 2FA and caught on that it was a scam almost immediately, but I doubt that 98-99% of people that get this would realize it and would have unlocked their #coinbase accounts.  For those unaware, the code they sent was my actual 2FA, but they sent it from their own email and were logging into my account to drain it while we were on the phone.  Attached are the texts, phone calls and email from the scammers.  Like and retweet to spread awareness please. Thanks.",06/13/2023 11:30 PM,True,5404,2297,830

236,Mark Cuban,"The SEC could have easily have gone to them and outlined an exact plan to get them to compliance.  Then if @coinbase or whoever didn't comply, they sue over whatever legal disagreements they have.   Instead they do what they told one of my companies to do when we called, read these cases and get a lawyer to figure it out for you.    That's the fundamental problem of the SEC.  They don't want to help companies get to compliance they want to challenge them to get to compliance    They are full of lawyers.  Lawyers want to litigate.  If you had business people , more like the SBA, there would be more compliance , fewer lawsuits and better investor education and protections .  But if that happened, 2k SEC lawyers would be out of a job.    This isn't new.   It's been the same for decades.  They promote the number of cases and wins the get as their metrics rather than the number of companies they helped get into compliance and the impact those companies had on gdp, jobs and investor returns.    At that point the impact they have on protecting investors would be profound and stand out and most likely they would find the bad actors before they stole money because the connection to investors and real companies would be stronger and they would be willing to communicate about the bad actors.   As it is, no one wants to talk to the SEC because no one trusts them for fear of being in the same situation as @coinbase finds itself    You get what you measure",06/07/2023 04:55 PM,True,3173,604,231
237,"nic ""bankful"" carter","Imagine a Christian getting to heaven's gate and realizing their God wasn't God, but instead Allah, or Krishna, or Zeus, or Thor. And then seeing sinners and heathens ascending the stairs to the holy gates too. That's Bitcoiners realizing that they bet on the wrong horse. That there wasn't anything particular moral or pure or sacred about Bitcoin, and that the world doesn’t actually care about how immaculate the conception really was.  In the second world, in which Bitcoin continued to thrive, but other coins did so as well, and perhaps surpassed it, the laser eyes would have to admit that they never had any special insight. That the revelations they had so keenly felt were shadows and illusions. That their gurus were false prophets. And this crisis of faith – inching closer every day thanks to simple material reality – is too painful to bear, so they pray and hope for the collapse of all of the sh*tcoins and the impure Bitcoin competitors and all of the distractions to the ordained mission.  So even though Binance and Coinbase did something immensely good for Bitcoin, and surely added tens or hundreds of billions to its market cap by virtue of the tools they built to support it, they didn’t do it in a pure way. They sinned by building technology for other coins. By allowing ETH and SOL and XRP to thrive alongside Bitcoin, too. They sinned by not following the holy virtue of Self Custody at all costs (notwithstanding of course that the market didn’t _want_ self custody). They sinned by not prioritizing the ordained Scaling Solution of Truth in the form of the Lightning Network but instead building other products (that their users wanted) first.  They sinned by (allegedly, in the diseased minds of maxis) creating “paper” Bitcoin out of thin air, thus wrongfully driving down the price of Bitcoin with dilution that wouldn’t otherwise exist. (This is a classic goldbug myth that the Bitcoiners inherited for some deranged reason). But most of all they sinned by being polytheists in a monotheist world. And for that, they deserve to be destroyed. Even if Binance operates the biggest p2p onramp to Bitcoin in the global south. (The laser eyes are unconcerned with data or empirical facts.) Even if Coinbase went to bat for Bitcoin versus US regulators for over a decade. Even if the two firms custody more Bitcoin for end users than anyone else. This doesn’t matter. They’re impure, and laser eye Bitcoiners aren’t here for the profit or the adoption. They’re here to feel morally superior, to dunk on sh*tcoiners, to accelerate towards the rapture in which all fiat dies. They aren’t trying to reform the existing system or accept half-measures like third party custody, even if highly credible. They aren’t here for distractions like DeFi or Web3. They’re here to act out an imagined monetary revolution, mainly on twitter.  This is why the laser eye reaction to the US government attacking stalwart firms like Coinbase or Binance is so revealing. The maxis don’t care about actual progress or key wins for the industry. They don’t care about the 100m+ individuals using these firms to hold their coins. They don’t care about adoption. They don’t even care about price appreciation (remember, their desire for in-group kinship far exceeds their economic motive). They care about being pure, adhering to the imagined codes of conduct set by their gurus. Even though they ostensibly disdain the usage of state power, they are more than happy to wield it against their enemies if it achieves the goals of the revolution. They care about treasuring the sacred and attacking the profane.  Like all secular cults, the Bitcoin maxi cult is borne out of a loss of meaning in modern society. These people are mostly outcasts who believe that society exists in a fallen state, only to be restored by a monetary revolution. Happy, functional people don’t spend their days weaving conspiracies about how Jay Powell is specifically conspiring against them. I’m sympathetic to their search for meaning, but unfortunately as with many secular cults, their programming has gone haywire. Like ducklings believing a human stranger is their mommy, the laser eyes have imprinted upon a technology and wrongly believe it will be their salvation. It’s nothing of the sort. It’s a tool, a very good one, but nothing more. It’s not a culture and it’s not a way of life.  Unfortunately, the maxi cult isn’t interested in adoption or the success and proliferation of Bitcoin, but merely its advance in a theologically acceptable manner. But their cult is exclusionary and trades off against the actual usage of Bitcoin as a way to promote financial liberation. For this reason, the maxi cult must be resisted at all costs. Bitcoin’s fat depends on it.  (2/2)",06/07/2023 04:02 AM,True,1216,156,334
238,"nic ""bankful"" carter","If you're somewhat new to the space and you're wondering why self-professed Bitcoiners today cheered on SEC attacks against the two most important Bitcoin companies of all time, Coinbase and Binance, let me explain...  There's ""people who use Bitcoin"" aka Bitcoiners (the vast majority, ordinary people) and there's people that turned Bitcoin into a secular cult. Call this latter group ""laser eyes"" or ""maxis"", whatever you want, they know who they are, we know who they are. There's no uncertainty about this – they are people that elevated Bitcoin from a mere tool to a belief system, a way of life. (They like to quibble over the language but everyone knows who is who here.)  The vast majority of these cult adherents are actually new to Bitcoin. Look at their profiles – mostly created 2021 and 2022. They are latecomers, drawn in by the rally in 2021 and the promise of riches and endless price appreciation spun by gurus on Clubhouse during the Covid era. They believed in fallacies like the stock to flow model. They were also attracted to the idea that Bitcoin was not only financially sound, but morally superior too. It was better than the sh*tcoins, better than fiat. By merely tithing your Bitcoin every month, you could bring about a financial transformation to a fairer world, and when fiat and everything else collapsed, you'd be one of the chosen few to be the kings in the new world, a ruler among the ruins.  So why are they giddy about the possible obliteration of Coinbase and Binance, who have collectively onboarded 100m-200m individuals worldwide to crypto and, specifically, Bitcoin? These are de-facto crypto banks for the entire globe, and made owning Bitcoin easy and simple for tens and maybe hundreds of millions. More than anyone, these two firms have made mainstream adoption of Bitcoin possible. Why would the laser eyes cheer government attacks against them?  It's simple. The cultists are intellectually short crypto, more than they are financially long Bitcoin. For the most part, they don't actually have meaningful economic upside in Bitcoin. Since they joined in 2021/22 they mostly lost money in real terms ""stacking sats"". They think that they will eventually be rewarded for their piety, but for now, the amount of real goods they can buy with their sat hoard is actually dwindling. They aren't interested in Bitcoin adoption, or usage of Bitcoin increasing worldwide, because that's not what they're here for. They're here to find social kinship within an in-group of people that lives in a Bitcoiny way. They're here for the party, not for business.  So what attracts these people to Bitcoin? Simply, the secular cult. It's a way of life for people that live on the margins of society – people that would otherwise be conspiracists, goldbugs, radical libertarians, etc. Generally, they're unhappy with the status quo and find it convenient to blame central bankers and interest rates, and ultimately ""fiat culture"" for everything wrong with society. Whether this is financial cycles, debt, war, or even more far fetched things like culture, art, food, or fertility. It's all the fault of government spending, inflation, and the debauching effect of fiat money on society. These people believe that they can find a kind of liberation in Bitcoin, especially one that comes at the expense of their fellow man, who they believe is condemned to a kind of financial hellfire that will purge all fiat, Sodom and Gomorrah style. The great flood will come and only Bitcoin will remain. David Gerard once called the laser eye religion an “apocalyptic death cult,” and he’s mostly right. The entire ideology is premised on the End of fiat, the end of degeneracy, of debt binges, of credit, of largesse, and all of its symptoms in society, and the rebuilding of society around a more honest monetary foundation – after a period of complete destruction and anarchy, of course.  (Of course, there's a kernel of truth to everything here, but there's a vast difference between plain observations and the crafting of a literal secular cult around these ideas).  Laser eyes or Bitcoin maximalism isn't ""like a religion,"" it's literally one. It has everything a religion has, and it makes specific claims about genesis, piety, and salvation.  There's a doctrine of absolution/salvation – any sin, no matter how heinous is forgiven if you repent, forsake sh*tcoins, and embrace bitcoin. They really mean this too – I mean look at some of the most prominent Bitcoin maxi gurus, with grim pasts involved in shilling ICOs to retail. All forgiven post Bitcoin baptism.  There's a conception myth. Bitcoin was created in a uniquely perfect and fair way, nothing else can come close to that, and nothing like that can ever exist again. Only Satoshi's divine Proof of Work and lack of premine can foster a truly global decentralized commodity money.  There's religious texts. Satoshi's original scripture, the white paper, the forum posts, and the subsequent exegesis – the Bitcoin Standard and many others.  There’s specific cultural rituals: eating meat, shooting guns, promoting masculinity, hierarchy, the nuclear family, disdaining progressivism and feminism, and endorsing a kind of ascetism and privation.  There's a tithe – stack your sats every two weeks from your paycheck and even if you're losing money (which these class of 2021 Bitcoiners generally have done), you are still doing good, because it's working for the benefit of the church of Bitcoin. (Contrary to what many people think, Bitcoinism isn’t like the ‘prosperity gospel’ strand of Christianity. In fact, it’s the opposite. Laser eye Bitcoiners actually celebrate privation, emphasizing the sacrifices they make to grow their Bitcoin stack (think of it as a financial equivalent of religious fasting). This is also why they call themselves “plebs” – as a way to claim kinship with the working class “little guy.” Again, remember that these are latecomers. They needed to find a moral high ground over the established crypto elites, that mostly made money from their participation in the space, and the pure, underprivileged Bitcoin plebs. If you lack skills or a means to contribute to the industry or to make money from it, the next best thing is to claim a kind of working class, honest virtue, by calling yourself a pleb and thus morally elevating yourself over the impure money grubbing opportunistic elites.)  There's an eschatology – the fiat apocalypse / hyperinflation / great debt bubble is coming and no financial asset will be spared, except for the Chosen One (Bitcoin). After the rapture, the Bitcoiners will inherit the earth, and a handful of sats in your wallet today will buy city blocks in the future. You may be a mere pleb today, but you are a baron tomorrow.  There's rituals: making the pilgrimage to El Salvador to make a lightning payment at McDonalds, sweltering in the heat at Bitcoin Miami to see your gurus spout platitudes on stage, paying some twitter influencer $500 for a gristly cut of steak, listening to the same six podcasts host the same dozen guests week in, week out. Trolling the nocoiners and the sh*tcoiners on twitter. Telling your own story of how you ""found bitcoin"" and how it gave you structure and purpose after your divorce. Recruiting new adherents to the cult.  So what does this have to do with Binance and Coinbase? Well even though these firms have done more for Bitcoin adoption and accessibility than literally any other companies in the industry’s history, they are impure, because they listed other coins. They built what people wanted, and that was tools and applications beyond just Bitcoin. The laser eyes harp about Brian Armstrong's early tweets about being focused on Bitcoin, before he learned from the market that to survive, he had to build what people actually wanted, not what a small minority of zealots insisted on. (This is why you wont find any maxis building real companies, because to be a founder is to be forced to accept market realities, rather than trying to impose your ideology forcibly on the world.)  Binance and Coinbase may have made questionable listing and product decisions (and to be clear, they're very different companies, with different regulatory strategies and risk appetites, so I don't mean to imply they are similar in that respect), but they did provide the tools for Bitcoin to achieve global adoption in a way that wasn't possible before.  But these laser eyes see the world through the lens of the sacred and the profane. They aren't focused on Bitcoin's success. They would rather live in a world of purity in which Bitcoin is marginal and niche (but all competing coins had failed), than a fallen world in which Bitcoin is much bigger, but other blockchains survived and thrived. To live in this second would would be to admit that Bitcoin wasn't Special and Uniquely Good and Moral, but it was simply a tool, one tool among others, some of which proved more successful and adaptive. If this second world came to pass, Bitcoiners would have to accept that their God was a false one, that their faith was misplaced, that their ordained future didn't and would never occur. Even if the fiat apocalypse did come, and Bitcoiners weren't uniquely saved, but others were too.  (1/2)",06/07/2023 04:01 AM,True,3903,784,979

288,Robert F. Kennedy Jr,"The claim that FedNow is not the first step toward a CBDC would be more easily digestible were we not aware of the Biden administration’s steady barrage of hostile broadsides against cryptocurrencies.  Between 2008-22, the Fed partnered with a handful of big banks to print $10 trillion-ten centuries of wealth in 15 years — a bonanza for the Banksters.   Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin give the public an escape route from the splatter zone when this bubble invariably bursts. So the White House is colluding with the banksters to keep us all trapped in the bubble of profiteering and control.  In his Feb. 8 post on Pirate Wires, Nic Carter @nic__carter describes how the White House has organized bankers to participate in a sophisticated, widespread crackdown to destroy the crypto industry. Carter describes 15 incidents where President Biden has weaponized FDIC, OCC + DOJ to force crypto-friendly banks to close their doors to crypto firms since Dec. 3. The recent crackdown on crypto blocks exit ramps, removes alternative rails, and strengthens government control over both the financial and political systems.  We should be wary since CBDCs are the ultimate mechanisms for social surveillance and control. As Balaji Srinivasan @balajis says, “The distinction between FedNow and a CBDC is important from a technical standpoint, but not from a civil liberties standpoint.” Balaji compares FedNow to “a virus that has evolved to evade recognition by changing its sequence without really changing its function.""",04/10/2023 06:51 PM,True,24288,7553,1270
