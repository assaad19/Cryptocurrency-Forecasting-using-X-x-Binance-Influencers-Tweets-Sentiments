234,Breakout,"FX Prop Is Dying. Join Crypto.  FX currently dominates the prop trading space.  While futures and crypto have seen a modest increase in popularity, FX is the most popular market.  Breakout is a crypto-only prop firm built by crypto native traders, investors, and builders. While we‚Äôre undoubtedly biased on this matter, it is our view that FX traders should consider expanding their trading to include crypto.  The immediate retort might be ‚ÄúBut my FX prop firm also offers crypto!‚Äù  No ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt.  Your FX prop firm likely offers garbled crypto CFDs with wide spreads, archaic listings, and at times even limited trading hours.  Breakout is the first and only prop firm to offer crypto trading with liquidity sourced from a tier 1 centralized exchange (Bybit), 80+ constantly-updated listings, and 24/7 trading. Our pricing and liquidity are derived from Bybit‚Äôs perpetual futures contracts ‚Äì the most liquid and highly-traded instruments in crypto. Breakout is the only firm that is fully in tune with the needs of crypto-native traders, and this involves the ability to list new coins at the same pace as major centralized exchanges.  Trading conditions aside, there are plenty of other reasons why FX traders should consider expanding their trading to include crypto. This article will outline a few of them.  24/7 Trading  Crypto is always available to trade.  No weekends. No public holidays. No obtuse opening and closing hours.  Crypto trades 24/7.  Beyond the convenience factor of always being able to trade a market, 24/7 generally expands the scope of opportunities on any given week to trade, pass an evaluation, and get funded.  5 trading days (with sometimes odd hours) vs 7 trading days (24/7) makes a difference. Especially given that weekends in crypto can be rife with altcoin opportunities and setups that simply do not happen in FX.  Lastly, aside from being closed on the weekend, FX traders have to deal with some form of high impact news almost every week. While this may ordinarily present an opportunity to trade, it is common for FX firms to place restrictions around news trading (if not prohibit it entirely).  Crypto, on the other hand, offers opportunities every day ‚Äì without the ‚Äòhelp‚Äô of an economic calendar.  Higher Volatility  Liquid crypto is a traders‚Äô paradise.  Rather than levering up 1000x to make lunch money from a 0.0001% move in some major currency pair, high market cap high liquidity crypto pairs move 5%-20% in a day quite regularly.  For traders, volatility means opportunity, and crypto is king of that realm.  Rather than levering up and staring at the 1-minute chart to scalp EUR/USD at the open, crypto allows you to quite comfortably day trade and swing trade much larger moves without the need for extremely high leverage or the use of micro time frames.  Fewer Correlations, More Dispersion  While altcoins generally correlate quite positively with BTC (even this has been strained recently), there is a lot of dispersion among altcoins themselves.  This means that out of the dozens of liquid altcoins available in the market ‚Äì with over 80 of them available on Breakout ‚Äì there are plenty of opportunities to trade both directions on any given day.  Rather than having to determine a bias from DXY or EUR/USD, crypto allows you to find uncorrelated coins, isolated moves, narrative-based trades, pair trades, and more.  In general, crypto trading is less ‚Äòtop heavy‚Äô and thus presents a wider range of trade opportunities.  Faster and Wider Swing Trade Opportunities  Swing trading is one of the more popular trading styles in the prop space.  Unlike in FX, where the % moves are much smaller and swings may take weeks and months to resolve on high time frames, crypto swing trades are plentiful and move very quickly ‚Äì especially if the market is at a cyclical turning point.  Additionally, crypto swings tend to be less choppy ‚Äì if your timing is right at a key inflection point, the market generally wastes no time in moving in your favor and it does so quickly.  These swings either validate or invalidate your ideas pretty quickly, meaning less time lost to ambiguous chop while you sit in a trade whose outcome is still unclear weeks (potentially even months) down the line.  New Coins, New Opportunities  Crypto is predicated on innovation.  As a result, it is common to see many new coins become popular ‚Äì especially if the market is hot.  These coins are unburdened by historic holders looking to unload, and newer participants do not have past price action to anchor their views. Additionally, newer traders generally flock towards these new listings, which generally makes for much ‚Äòcleaner‚Äô price action.  Given these new opportunities are often retail-heavy, basic price action, patterns, and technical indicators are more reliable as 1) the valuation of something new is a tricky exercise; and 2) those are primarily the tools used by newer traders, thus creating an order herding effect.  In summary, new listings entail more opportunities.  Fewer Sophisticated Market Participants  Crypto attracts many first-time market participants, for whom trading these markets is their first foray into speculation.  Candidly, this means less sophistication, more inefficiencies, and more opportunities for good trades.  This is similar to the idea of table selection in poker: if you want to do well, you‚Äôre probably not going to pick the table with the sharks if you can avoid it.  As per the previous point, especially on newer coins, the types of participants are both relatively new to markets while also being technical analysis-focused. In essence, this means you‚Äôll be trading against on average less experienced traders using straightforward TA and indicator signals, which are easy to identify and take advantage of.  Compared to the funds and desks managing hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars in FX, your counterparties in crypto are (on average) less experienced and the trading environment is less competitive on the whole.  Summary  The preceding list inexhaustive. There are plenty of other reasons to trade crypto.  Honorable mentions go to seamlessly integrated payment options all done via crypto, the availability of level 2 data at either low or no cost, and the regulatory and operational uncertainties that appear to be plaguing FX firms across the board.  In any case, we hope you are at least interested in trying crypto trading.

277,Breakout,"We are making 2 changes to the Breakout trading experience.  1. Switching Steps  Previously, traders were required to gain 10% in the first step of the Breakout Evaluation and gain 5% in the second step in order to gain access to a Breakout Account.  These steps have now been reversed: step 1 will be the easier step (5% account gain) and step 2 will be the more difficult step (10% account gain).  This should provide a more intuitive trading experience, as the easier step will come first as traders become acquainted with our platform.  2. Adding an Effective Funding Rate  Breakout is the only prop firm offering a centralized exchange-like trading experience. We source our liquidity from Bybit's perpetual futures.  A core component of trading perpetual futures, especially in these market conditions, is the funding rate i.e. the fee you pay/receive for holding an open position.  On account of current market conditions, we're adding an effective funding rate to all instruments.  Traders will be charged 9 basis points (0.09%) per open position per day on the notional value of the trade, irrespective of direction (long/short). This reflects the 3 basis points (or higher) every 8 hours that traders are paying on centralized exchanges. The effective funding rate will be deducted from your account at the daily close i.e. 0000 UTC.  This change will bring us even closer in line with a crypto native centralized exchange trading experience, and also smoothen our transition to routing Breakout Account trades to the live market (more on that soon).  ü´°",03/25/2024 04:55 PM,True,54,7,15

410,Cred,"A few common mistakes in these conditions:  1. Excessive leverage. Specifically, introducing liquidation risk in assets that are regularly moving 10%-20%+ in a day. Let the volatility do the heavy lifting, not the leverage (or specifically, massively inflated position sizes facilitated by leverage that force you to use very tight stops or liquidate you on small moves against you).  2. Excessively tight stops. Same consideration. If you're targeting larger rotations in a higher volatility asset, being overly tight with stop placement can work against you. You don't want to create a loop where your idea is broadly correct, you get wicked out because you were LARPing as some 50R tick sniper, and then the market moves straight to your target without you.  3. Excessive rotation. If you're trying to make the most of a multi-week and multi-month trending period, you shouldn't be overly concerned with any specific 24H window of returns. It is a form of overtrading. It is also a form of FOMO. This also introduces the risk of creating a loop whereby you sell your bags to chase the strong stuff --> strong stuff consolidates --> the bags you sold moon --> repeat ad infinitum. Find some setups or ideas that you like and give them some room to breathe.  4. Mistaking consolidation for weakness. This is another version of time-based FOMO. Participants will infer that just because their bags haven't turbo mooned in a short period of time, the market is weak or they've allocated poorly. Instead, your rebuttable presumption should be that consolidations are a form of pullback and present an opportunity to buy stuff that eluded you when it was breaking out. Boredom and impatience do not necessarily signal weakness.  5. Excessive trade management. The degree to which you intervene in your trade ideas should somewhat mirror the time frames of those ideas. For example, if your trade is predicated on a breakout from a multi-week range, your targets and trade management time frames should be derived from (or resemble) the weekly time frame. That makes more sense than, for example, buying a large weekly breakout and setting a target at 15M resistance that's 5% higher and panicking over every red 5M candle.  6. Overtrading your core holdings. There are countless stories of traders getting very good swing and/or HTF positional entries but gradually fumbling them through trying to time every single dip and rotation that takes place on the way to their target. An unfortunately common version of this is selling 100% of exposure at some level in order to 'buy back lower'. This is particularly a strange choice when a trader's target is materially higher than the pullback they're hoping to rebuy. For example, if your ultimate target is 50% higher, is it worth selling all of your exposure in an attempt to time a 5%-10% dip? This can result in the market not offering the pullback that was hoped for, and now the trader is sidelined - this usually comes with a mental block, as buying back higher than you sold can be psychologically tricky/feels like you're chasing. In short, this is a form of overoptimisation. If you're bored and feel like gambling in between, use a sub account or @breakoutprop (disclaimer: I have a financial interest in its success) so you can scratch the trading itch without sabotaging yourself. Or go to the casino, get a hobby, whatever.  7. Excessive number of open positions. With every added position, your capacity to effectively manage any single position decreases. The altcoin market is still pretty tightly positively correlated, so you're more likely just spreading yourself thin rather than 'diversifying'. Focusing on a smaller number of higher conviction trade ideas and managing them patiently and judiciously is probably better than trying to catch everything at once and drowning in noise. If you want to spread yourself thin, go buy some Solana shitter lottery tickets i.e. X amount of $ across [large number] of memecoins/new coins that will either go to 0 or appear on your feed when you're up multiples. At least that doesn't take up your trade management RAM.  8. Allowing social media to materially impact your perception. It's PnL + leaderboard season. It may feel like absolutely everyone is winning massively all the time. Granted, the market has been very good unless you've been stubbornly short, but social media is still a highlight reel boosted by selection bias and survivorship bias. You don't see the fumbled entries, the break evens, the times traders got stopped at the bottom, undersizing great ideas and oversizing bad ideas, not pulling the trigger, and so on. As long as you're trading well and improving, don't try to speed run some arbitrary returns or net worth goal.  TL;DR I ain't reading all that. I'm happy for u tho.
