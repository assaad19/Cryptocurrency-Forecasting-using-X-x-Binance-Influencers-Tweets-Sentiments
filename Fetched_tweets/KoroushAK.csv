0,Koroush AK,"First crypto bull market I almost became a millionaire.  Second crypto bull market I reached financial freedom.  I now can work with whoever I want, whenever and do whatever.  Lessons learned along the way:        1. $10mil+ is enough to retire, despite what crypto X says.  2. Retirement sucks but freedom is great.  3. Trading is more a human psychology game than a numbers game.  4. Prepare in the bear market and the bull market is money printing.  5. People will always think you got lucky. Don't take it personally, it's just cope.  6. Every trading day in a bull market is like two weeks in a bear market.  7. Once you learn consistency, you can succeed at anything.  8. People who get crazy rich quickly from crypto end up in jail or broke.  9. 5 good X accounts are enough to get all the crypto market information you need.  10. Watch ""Blue Lock"" or ""Kengan Ashura"" when you feel burnt out.  11. 90% of people will make more money buying $BTC + $ETH and chilling.  12. The other 10% have done my free crypto trading course on telegram.  13. Build long term things only. Once the bull market ends, everything short term collapses.  14. Never idolise individuals. We're all human and flawed.  15. There is a brutal invisible tax if you get rich through luck. You pay with the constant fear of losing wealth that isn't earned.  16. Make patience your edge, no one wants to copy that.  17. The greatest pleasures in life are free.",10/12/2023 01:53 PM,False,4675,780,470

He said the words, “New Internet” and I couldn’t ignore it.  For 100s of years, we’ve seen “bubbles” (opportunities) occur:  1. Tulip Mania (1637), when the price of tulip bulbs shot to extraordinary prices before collapsing dramatically.  2. South Sea Bubble (1720), when shares of the South Sea Company went to the moon, later crashing as they failed to match the hype.  3. Dot-Com Bubble (early 2000s), when the internet companies rose astronomically, only to crash after reaching unsustainable levels.  The Housing Bubble  The ICO Bubble  DeFi Summer  NFTs Craze  Memecoin madness  The list goes on  What if you had the vision to spot these opportunities and capitalize on them?  This is how I got into crypto.  There was luck involved.  But the hours spent studying and working on myself weren’t an accident.

Monday to Friday,  I wake up at 06:00 high protein meal  At 6:45 I meditate for a minimum of 15 minutes. This is my mental health check-in and maintenance.  07:00 I turn on the computer and update charts for $BTC, $ETH, and any other assets on my watchlist.   I'll look at the top movers of the day and check market news/sentiment.  By 07:30 I have all the data I need to prepare my trading plan for the day. I set alerts at key price levels or key volume/volatility levels.  Then I wait.  I only need to trade if an alert goes off.  If an alert goes off I return to the charts and execute my plan.  If nothing happens I focus on my business or I go climb a mountain.  The hardest part of trading is not doing stupid stuff while waiting.  20:00 is my hard cut off for trading. I need to prioritise sleep to perform the next day.  22:00 I sleep.  Saturdays I don't trade.  Sundays I focus on reviews and improvements.  Simple and effective routine.

Copy trade influencers. Make sure to have as many opinions as possible (besides your own) before making any decisions.  6. Don't journal trades. Just go with your gut feel, writing is for nerds.  7. Try to figure it all out yourself. Don't look for guidance, in courses, mentors or books.  8. Use as many strategies as possible. Make sure they're as complicated as possible.  9.

This is my Bull Market Exit Playbook:  1. Systematic Profit  This leaves 0 room for emotional error.  Take profit every time total crypto portfolio goes +x%  High risk approach: Take profit when TOTAL portfolio +100%  Low risk: Take profit when TOTAL portfolio goes +15%  Individual trades can still run 10x.  Example: You buy a coin with 5% of portfolio, it goes 10x, that's ~ +50%   Be high risk early and lower risk later in the bull market.  2. I reduce risk every time something really stupid happens.  Example: $30mil sent to a presale address in 1 hour.  Reduce risk means, I target smaller deviations.   E.g instead of +50% I start looking for +30%  3. Always ask ""If the bull market ended tomorrow, would I be fine?""  If the answer to this question is ever no, reposition yourself.  4.
