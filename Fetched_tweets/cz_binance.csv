Fun and playful. 4. The G is a tongue sticking out from the mouth, inspired by the emoji 😋.  5. The outline of the face can be a sunflower, symbolizing livelihood and fast growth. 6. The outline of the face is two overlapping squares. Once you see it, it is hard to unsee it. This is to show our respect to our “Binance heritage”, whose logo is more squarely. 7. The color is yellow and black, also owing to our “Binance heritage”. Although, the yellow is a light yellow, more playful. 8.

In our target market, Android is probably the first device a household gets, before a laptop. Smart phones also have a touch screen, which is easier for kids to interact with.

39,CZ 🔶 BNB,"Today, I stepped down as CEO of Binance. Admittedly, it was not easy to let go emotionally. But I know it is the right thing to do. I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself.  Binance is no longer a baby. It is time for me to let it walk and run. I know Binance will continue to grow and excel with the deep bench it has.  I’m pleased to announce that @_RichardTeng, our now former Global Head of Regional Markets, has been named the new CEO of Binance today.  Richard is a highly qualified leader and, with over three decades of financial services and regulatory experience, he will navigate the company through its next period of growth. He will ensure Binance delivers on our next phase of security, transparency, compliance, and growth.  Prior to joining Binance, Richard was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM); Chief Regulatory Officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX); and Director of Corporate Finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  With Richard and the entire team, I’m confident that the best days for @Binance and the crypto industry lay ahead.  As a shareholder and former CEO with historical knowledge of our company, I will remain available to the team to consult as needed, consistent with the framework set out in our U.S. agency resolutions.  What’s next for me?  I will take a break first. I have not had a single day of real (phone off) break for the last 6 and half years.  After that, my current thinking is I will probably do some passive investing, being a minority token/shareholder in startups in areas of blockchain/Web3/DeFi, AI and biotech. I am happy that I will finally have more time to spend looking at DeFi.  I can’t see myself being a CEO driving a startup again. I am content being an one-shot (lucky) entrepreneur. Should there be listeners, I may be open to being a coach/mentor to a small number of upcoming entrepreneurs, privately. If for nothing else, I can at least tell them what not to do.  On that note, I am proud to point out that in our resolutions with the U.S. agencies they:  - do not allege that Binance misappropriated any user funds, and - do not allege that Binance engaged in any market manipulation.  Funds are SAFU!  With that, I look forward to seeing the new leadership take the reins. Please join me in congratulating Richard on his well-deserved promotion.  Onwards!

226,CZ 🔶 BNB,"Guess what? You can be criticized when you donate $3 million dollars worth of crypto after an earthquake.  While we got overwhelming positive feedback from our users about the donation (as seen in the quoted tweet), and while the issues raised are typically from traditional charity organizations who are not familiar with crypto, we still take the feedback seriously.  Here are 5 common issues raised:  1. People need food and water, not crypto.   We agree with that. Binance has dual programs. Binance has a history of providing essential items. Eg, food, water, masks, and even oxygen tanks that can save 12,000 people for covid victims in India, etc. These take time to organize. Crypto is fast.  2. People need cash, not crypto.   Crypto can be converted to cash readily, especially for our users.   A non crypto person saying crypto is not cash is like a blind person saying lights are useless.  3. The donation only helps our users, not all people in need.  We agree with that. We can only reach our users at this speed. We are not saying we can solve all problems, but we try to help the little bit where we can. That’s what donations are.  4. Some of our users receiving the donation are not in affected areas.  We use a tiered system where our users closer to the epicenter get more. The POA (proof of address) system is not perfect, but it's what we got.  We believe the earthquake has long term economic impact for the country as a whole. Helping our users can't hurt.  5. Why don’t we donate through traditional charity organizations?   Actually, we do. Charity donations do not have to be mutually exclusive. Binance works with many leading charity organizations in the world.  Traditional charities have some issues too though. The lack of traceability makes it difficult for our internal impact analysis.  With crypto, I can tell you we helped about 70,000 people in Morocco, and another 12,000 people in Libya.  We believe in direct giving.

263,CZ 🔶 BNB,"Saw some debates in the community. When you do the right thing, and there is FUD, you don't have to do anything. The community defends you.  Let me summarize. There have been a lot of negative news/rumors, bank runs, lawsuits, closing of fiat channels, product wind downs, employee turnover, exit markets, etc.  Guess what we don't have?  No liquidity issues. All withdrawals (and deposits) are properly handled. All customer funds are #SAFU, and 100% reserved.  There are also: won court cases, bank run handled and then record deposits, new fiat channels, smooth sunsetting of old products and launching of new products, new hires, new markets.  Binance probably also have the lowest founding team turnover of any tech startup of our size and age, in the world.  Build. 🤷‍♂️",09/07/2023 08:16 PM,False,8210,1379,1489

268,Hypnogaba,"My experience with @binance .  Now, as always in recent years, the world's largest crypto exchange is getting a lot of fud. Not only regulators are trying to limit the possibilities for DEXes (and users in the end), but also entire countries in one form or another are trying to ""protect"" their citizens more and more by limiting access to different financial instruments.   I am not against restrictions and regulations. I know that Binance was one of the co-authors of the innovative legislation for France and the whole of Europe, MICA, which was supposed to develop the rules of the game and make life easier for ordinary users and protect their rights.   But today is not about that.  My experience has shown that @binance  has become a salvation for me over the past 3 years. Because of the war, all external payments from my country were blocked. And since I had some savings in the bank, if it wasn't for Binance and their p2p service, I would not have been able to get my money. Also, with the help of the Binance card, I am able to receive my salary and pay for my daily needs. All over the world. Easily and securely. Due to certain circumstances, I also switched to Binance earn as the most stable and profitable way to store my funds and receive passive income.   What's my point? I'm just a simple person, but life would be much more difficult for me without the features offered by Binance.   Looking to the future, I realize that cryptocurrencies and the modern digital services of WEB3 will not disappear.  That's why I registered a sub-account and save money for my daughter's education there) Because I know that in 18 years they will be there+ with a good % on top.   My post is a regular user's post, a post of a person who is grateful for everything that @cz_binance  and @davidprincay create.  I feel that this multi-million dollar corporation is doing its best  for all its users and I appreciate it.  THANK YOU.",09/06/2023 07:22 AM,True,781,156,237
