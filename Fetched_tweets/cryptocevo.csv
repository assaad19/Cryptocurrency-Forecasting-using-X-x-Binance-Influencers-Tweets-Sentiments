Some of us were early investors in NuklaiData, securing positions at a remarkable pre-launch price of $0.003. Congratulations to those who seized this opportunity! For those looking to get a position; I anticipate a potential pullback below $0.04.  A short summary of the project for those who are still unfamiliar with NuklaiData.   ‚úÖAI Advancement through Decentralization NuklaiData is crucial for advancing Artificial Intelligence (AI) by offering a decentralized platform for secure and efficient data sharing and processing.  ‚úÖThe Quest for Quality In AI, data is essential for powering algorithms. Think of data as the lifeblood of AI. However, accessing diverse, high-quality datasets can be tough due to privacy concerns, data silos, and centralized control.  ‚úÖLeveraging Blockchain NuklaiData tackles these challenges by using blockchain tech to build a decentralized marketplace. Here, data providers can securely share their datasets while keeping ownership and control.  ‚úÖDemocratizing Data This opens the door for AI researchers and developers to access a variety of datasets, fostering collaboration and speeding up the creation of better AI models.  ‚úÖEnsuring Data Integrity NuklaiData's transparency and immutability make sure that data is trustworthy. This means you don't have to worry about someone changing it, which is essential for AI because it needs reliable information.  ‚úÖDriving AI Progress To sum up, NuklaiData's decentralized platform not only makes data exchange seamless but also boosts innovation and collaboration in AI, pushing us closer to more advanced and impactful AI solutions.",04/20/2024 12:03 PM,True,130,21,30

You have to think about your exit when you are up like this, not to increase your avg entry.  6. Cash out regularly. Make connections with the bank and introduce yourself very well. You will need them when you start changing your life. Paper gains are nothing.   My last advice is to think like a bull in a bull market. The whole world might burn, if the market is bullish you just join the trend and ride till you are satisfied with the gains. Don‚Äôt try to time the top and find signals to fit your own bias.

Read on‚Ä¶  Crypto presents a very unique opportunity for wealth creation that is exciting and in many cases life changing.  I want to focus in on this key point: crypto can be LIFE CHANGING  What does this mean? Quite simply, if you make a lot of money, you can change your life if many ways:  - new car - buy a house - retire your parents, etc.  One of the most CRUCIAL parts of successful wealth creation, is understanding that past a certain point‚Ä¶the money doesn‚Äôt scale to the impact it will have on your life.  To make it very clear:  Your second million dollars will change your life INFINITELY LESS than your first.  Many people will make enough money to legitimately change their life forever (pay off debts, new house completely paid, college fund started for kids, etc.) and then they will RISK IT ALL to double their money.   What I‚Äôm trying to say is very very very simple:  If you make enough money to change your life, make sure you actually change it.  Do not risk an amount of money that can change your life forever, just so that you can then make your life a *little bit* better.  My one ask for anybody that reads this:  Find your number. Find the number that will change your life. Do NOT make this some arbitrary number like 2 million dollars. Write down the things that you need to change your life (car, house, debts, etc.) and then make that number your goal.  When you hit your goal, cash the fuck out.  If you don‚Äôt have a number, you will never stop until you lose it all. I promise you.  If you make enough money to change your life, make sure you actually change it.  The money does not scale.

One of the most promising new interoperability solutions is Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). CCIP enables cross-chain token transfers and message passing in a seamless and highly secure way.  I expect this protocol to be very successful, and that's why I'm very excited about this new cross-chain DEX @xswap_link which will be one of the very first protocols to integrate Chainlink‚Äôs CCIP technology.  XSwap is the first token led and brought to market by Chainlink's Incubator, and the first protocol to provide utility to the 21B+ dollars of $LINK tokens sitting idle.  XSwap enables cross-chain swaps between virtually any assets on any blockchains by utilizing CCIP for the cross-chain interactions and connections to DEX-es via aggregation. For the moment, the swap feature is in beta, and users can only swap between Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base and Optimism - but more chains are coming!  XSwap also offers a bridge for fast and secure cross-chain transfers, again powered by CCIP. There is currently a leaderboard designed to rank users based on their activity within the XSwap ecosystem - so it might be worth trying out the bridge and a few swaps. Do I hear airdrop? üëÄ  They‚Äôre also developing an SDK which will make it easy for other platforms to integrate swapping and bridging via XSwap, boosting trade volumes and revenue for the protocol!  The token for the project will be XSWAP, although you're so early it hasn't launched yet. It will be used for governance, revenue sharing fees from swaps and bridging, and there will even be a buyback and burn mechanism too!

Decentralized AI Layer 1. 2. Privacy: Efficient, fast and secure end-to-end encryption. (FHE and TFT) Optimized through a process called Cerberus Squeezing. 3. Large Language Models. 4.

The ability for any existing service provider to transform their standard LLM's (Llama) into ZK-LLM's with BasedLang. 7. Written in BasedLang, a novel meta programming standard made just for BasedAI, making it easier for any dev to work with LLM's (crypto and non crypto). 8. Future compatibility with newer LLM's like GPT-5.  By now, you should already have a basic understanding of how the BasedAI network works. Today, we will add to that knowledge.

374,jyp,"TLDR for the TRUE story behind @pepecoins and what is @getbasedai all about:    1. The OG @pepecoins is the first ever #memecoin we had next to @dogecoin in 2016. It didn't launch through an ICO or smart contract as it was released before #Ethereum was a thing. It launched through mining like $BTC and $doge coin.    2. It was under the radar because bittrex forced them to rebrand to stay listed on their CEX. Why? In 2016, Pepecoin faced a major challenge, white supremacists and right-wing ideologists began using Pepe to spread their ideology and it reached a climax when Donald Trump posted a Pepe meme of himself. Hilary then accused Trump's campaign of maliciously spreading those Pepe memes.    3. the Anti Defamation League went on to list Pepe as a hate symbol and ultimately @pepecoins was forced to rebrand from $pepe to $meme. [Yes, as a loyal holder of @memeland assets, $meme was not the OG. $meme from @pepecoins was.]    4. In response to that, the @pepecoin team launched KEKDAQ, a decentralized meme and asset exchange protocol where users can store, create and safeguard their memes and digital assets preserving their rarity via encrypted IPFS storage on the memetic blockchain. Ultimately, @pepecoins team built the first functioning NFT marketplace we ever had, way before @opensea was a thing but it was out of the reason to maintain free speech and internet culture.    5. In 2018, the blockchain underwent a hard fork and @pepecoins started its transition phase from POW to POS. Finally on 29 Apr 2023, the team bridged #pepecoin to Eth using utxo lockups and named the eth based pepecoin $PEPE. However, $pepe was stolen by @pepecoineth in 2023. Team at @pepecoins mentioned that the 2023 $pepe stole their idea, narrative and even the logo and ran with it. Team also mentioned that what these bad actors cannot steal is their ability to innovate and they will dev their way to the top.    6. So here comes the next major phase of @pepecoins evolution : @getbasedai What is #basedAI? They are building an open AI Layer1 network where anyone can run their own decentralized AI model, powered by GPU mining or proof of useful work (PoUW) as they call it.    7. Pepecoin trains AI models by using an open source peer to peer decentralized pool of gpus and a proof of useful work model named PEPEAI allowing them to tap into raw computing power and that pool offers to train their very own chat AI bot called CHAT-GP33.    8. What they are building is that you could use your computer's power to contribute to training AI models. It goes way beyond a simple Chatbot, it is an entire infrastructure that uses the collective power of Orphan miners to train AI. It covers a wide range of applications that companies usually spend Millions on.     9. Contributions are rewarded just like in traditional mining if you provide 10% of the work, you receive 10% of the reward without wasting energy.    10. You can buy #pepecoin now and stake it to earn #basedAI.    11. NFA, DYOR and investing in good teams is the best way to win in the coming cycle. ^if you sux at shitcoin trading.    12.

631,BATMAN ‚ö°,"You have probably seen the term ""inscriptions"" all over CT over the past few months. It's one of the hottest new trends in crypto, and isn't showing any signs of slowing down soon.  But what are inscriptions? Inscriptions are basically a new way of adding data to a blockchain such as Bitcoin by attaching it to the metadata of an individual cryptocurrency. On Bitcoin, for example, where inscriptions are currently most common, data such as text, images and videos is attached to individual sats (satoshis - the smallest unit of Bitcoin).  There's one protocol which is very well positioned to capture the growth of this new vertical - @inscribe_app  Inscribe is the first ever cross-chain inscriptions marketplace that enables users to trade inscriptions across multiple different blockchains in 1 unified hub. Version 0.1 is operational on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, ZkSync, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, Base, Fantom, Gnosis and Polygon!  Users can connect their preferred wallet like MM or Rabby and then purchase any inscription listed on Inscribe's marketplace, regardless of the chain it's on. Inscribe abstracts away the difficulty of bridging funds cross-chain and executing the transaction on the native chain, allowing users to interact with blockchains they are not natively operating on.  By offering a cross-chain marketplace with unified liquidity, Inscribe makes it easier than ever to trade this growing crypto asset class!  But Inscribe also offers many other inscription services beyond just a marketplace. The Inscribe web app and bot enables users to deploy, mint and transfer inscriptions on and between any connected chains. They‚Äôre also soon releasing their launchpad, with @Architex_ai already announced as the first project to be listed!  The platform will generate revenue by charging fees for their range on inscriptions services, and perhaps some of this revenue will be shared with stakers of the platform‚Äôs native token $INS  There is currently an ongoing incentivized points campaign, and with 7% of the supply allocated to an airdrop this could be a protocol worth interacting with!

Developed by the @TeamKujira team: $USK - The decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin developed by Kujira. Different kinds of assets can be used to mint $USK. #FIN - The decentralized order book exchange. Place limit orders in a decentralized way. #ORCA - The liquidation platform. Buy liquidated assets with a discount. #GHOST - The borrowing and lending platform. Borrow assets or lend them and earn yield. #BOW - Liquidity-providing tool that allows you to earn yield on your assets while it improves the trading experience on #FIN at the same time. #PILOT - A one-of-a-kind launchpad that enables you to determine the price you want to pay for a new token. #POD - A platform aiming to improve decentralization amongst the @cosmos ecosystem by helping you diversify your staked assets over different validators. #BLUE - The @TeamKujira dashboard and the place to mint $USK @SonarWallet - The mobile wallet developed by the team. It's still in beta but will develop into a mobile gateway that gives you access to all the @TeamKujira applications. @unstake_fi - The instant unstaking tool for the @cosmos interchain.  Other teams building on @TeamKujira: @AQLA_Token - The #RWA project focussing on carbon credits. @Fuzion_App - A team that's working on multiple products. One example is Plasma, the OTC desk on @TeamKujira. @Manta_DAO - @TeamKujira's #DeFi hub. It powers the most efficient swaps, and you can earn yield on your assets in their vaults. @TeamWinkHUB - The content house of @TeamKujira @CALC_Finance - Helps you to trade without emotions. @TeamLocalMoney - A decentralized P2P off/onramp @Quark_Protocol - Taking LSDs to the next level. Self-repaying loans and yield tokenization are two examples of what could be possible. @NamiProtocol - A stablecoin yield aggregator. @BlendProtocol - Allowing anyone to create a basket of assets that can be managed automatically @yieldharbour - The decentralized options trading protocol arriving on @TeamKujira soon  I couldn't be more bullish on @TeamKujira. Each day, the TVL rises, and the ecosystem grows. Double digits for $KUJI soon.  If I missed a project, I'm sorry.

This also doesn't account for on-chain volume in general rising which is another positive force making those volume numbers more likely.

833,Altcoin Sherpa,"Why do people like trading vs. just buy and hold?  A few reasons IMO:  it feels like you're actively making money and can 'pay yourself'.   Ie. you buy $BTC at 40k and you sell it at 42k. You have your principle $ and can cash out the profits to your bank account. You can take that $ and go to the next trade and also make $ actively  It feels much different than if you just buy BTC and hold it for 6 months. Because the trading aspect involves more skill and you can actually reap more rewards (when done correctly).   With that said, it's oftentimes hard to trade in certain conditions AND most people fuck it up. And in super strong bull markets, the majority of participants would probably be better off holding than actively trading.  Still, if you're full time crypto, you've got bills to pay. I get it. You need to make some $ and it feels lame to just buy some random small cap and wait for it to 100x. So you will continue to draw support/resistance lines on the chart and continue to learn.   The general path that I've seen most crypto participants go towards is:  Poor/grinding-> trading a ton, learning the ropes, trying to get any $ you can get, flip around, rotate, etc  Mid rich-> swing trading more, able to hold ideas longer, still have entry/exits, less rotation  Whale-> Less risk overall, happy to just have longer holding periods, maybe shift more to venture, more buy and hold and just go into a coma (aka DegenSpartan).   because the richer you are, the more you are in protection mode vs. pure growth.  I'm not saying you can't be profitable trading. It's much easier in the bull market when easy mode is on and you can simply buy every dip. But with that said, I think that the best path for most people is to just do research, buy some coins in a sector you like (ie. AI), and just hold and do your regular day to day.  But if you're actively in the trenches and actively trading every day because you are a degenerate and fighting with everyone else in the orderbooks...  As a fellow retail trader...
