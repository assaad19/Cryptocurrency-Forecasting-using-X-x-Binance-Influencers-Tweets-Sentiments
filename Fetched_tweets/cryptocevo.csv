Some of us were early investors in NuklaiData, securing positions at a remarkable pre-launch price of $0.003. Congratulations to those who seized this opportunity! For those looking to get a position; I anticipate a potential pullback below $0.04.  A short summary of the project for those who are still unfamiliar with NuklaiData.   ✅AI Advancement through Decentralization NuklaiData is crucial for advancing Artificial Intelligence (AI) by offering a decentralized platform for secure and efficient data sharing and processing.  ✅The Quest for Quality In AI, data is essential for powering algorithms. Think of data as the lifeblood of AI. However, accessing diverse, high-quality datasets can be tough due to privacy concerns, data silos, and centralized control.  ✅Leveraging Blockchain NuklaiData tackles these challenges by using blockchain tech to build a decentralized marketplace. Here, data providers can securely share their datasets while keeping ownership and control.  ✅Democratizing Data This opens the door for AI researchers and developers to access a variety of datasets, fostering collaboration and speeding up the creation of better AI models.  ✅Ensuring Data Integrity NuklaiData's transparency and immutability make sure that data is trustworthy. This means you don't have to worry about someone changing it, which is essential for AI because it needs reliable information.  ✅Driving AI Progress To sum up, NuklaiData's decentralized platform not only makes data exchange seamless but also boosts innovation and collaboration in AI, pushing us closer to more advanced and impactful AI solutions.",04/20/2024 12:03 PM,True,130,21,30

Invest with a thesis and have conviction. 2. Follow the progress of your investments and also keep other outperformers on your radar. 2. Take some off the table if it went up a lot and if you are not comfortable with the position size anymore. Your exit doesn’t matter, your avg exit does. 3. Keep some stables. The size of this depends on your portfolio. If you have a 3fig portfolio, go all in and take the risk. 4. If it goes down 15%-25%, do nothing. There is nothing exciting about this. Just hold spot and chill. 5. If it goes down +50% and the whole market went down like this, you can use the stables (if you didn’t cash out to the bank) to buy some alts you follow. Increase some of your bags that did well before if you don’t want to buy anything new. Don’t buy the bags you are up 25x or so, you will be emotionally invested if you do this. You have to think about your exit when you are up like this, not to increase your avg entry.  6. Cash out regularly. Make connections with the bank and introduce yourself very well. You will need them when you start changing your life. Paper gains are nothing.   My last advice is to think like a bull in a bull market. The whole world might burn, if the market is bullish you just join the trend and ride till you are satisfied with the gains. Don’t try to time the top and find signals to fit your own bias.

Read on…  Crypto presents a very unique opportunity for wealth creation that is exciting and in many cases life changing.  I want to focus in on this key point: crypto can be LIFE CHANGING  What does this mean? Quite simply, if you make a lot of money, you can change your life if many ways:  - new car - buy a house - retire your parents, etc.  One of the most CRUCIAL parts of successful wealth creation, is understanding that past a certain point…the money doesn’t scale to the impact it will have on your life.  To make it very clear:  Your second million dollars will change your life INFINITELY LESS than your first.  Many people will make enough money to legitimately change their life forever (pay off debts, new house completely paid, college fund started for kids, etc.) and then they will RISK IT ALL to double their money.   What I’m trying to say is very very very simple:  If you make enough money to change your life, make sure you actually change it.  Do not risk an amount of money that can change your life forever, just so that you can then make your life a *little bit* better.  My one ask for anybody that reads this:  Find your number. Find the number that will change your life. Do NOT make this some arbitrary number like 2 million dollars. Write down the things that you need to change your life (car, house, debts, etc.) and then make that number your goal.  When you hit your goal, cash the fuck out.  If you don’t have a number, you will never stop until you lose it all. I promise you.  If you make enough money to change your life, make sure you actually change it.  The money does not scale.   The diminishing returns of wealth are real.",03/30/2024 05:35 PM,True,1532,397,231

313,BATMAN ⚡,"The $XSWAP IDO and listing is getting closer, so I wrote a long post for you  With more and more L1's and L2's launching almost every day, interoperability between these chains will be more important than ever. One of the most promising new interoperability solutions is Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). CCIP enables cross-chain token transfers and message passing in a seamless and highly secure way.  I expect this protocol to be very successful, and that's why I'm very excited about this new cross-chain DEX @xswap_link which will be one of the very first protocols to integrate Chainlink’s CCIP technology.  XSwap is the first token led and brought to market by Chainlink's Incubator, and the first protocol to provide utility to the 21B+ dollars of $LINK tokens sitting idle.  XSwap enables cross-chain swaps between virtually any assets on any blockchains by utilizing CCIP for the cross-chain interactions and connections to DEX-es via aggregation. For the moment, the swap feature is in beta, and users can only swap between Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base and Optimism - but more chains are coming!  XSwap also offers a bridge for fast and secure cross-chain transfers, again powered by CCIP. There is currently a leaderboard designed to rank users based on their activity within the XSwap ecosystem - so it might be worth trying out the bridge and a few swaps. Do I hear airdrop? 👀  They’re also developing an SDK which will make it easy for other platforms to integrate swapping and bridging via XSwap, boosting trade volumes and revenue for the protocol!  The token for the project will be XSWAP, although you're so early it hasn't launched yet. It will be used for governance, revenue sharing fees from swaps and bridging, and there will even be a buyback and burn mechanism too!  I can't wait for $XSWAP to launch, and I recommend you follow @xswap_link to keep up to date with project developments!",03/30/2024 12:43 PM,True,766,163,284

Solving AI + privacy is one thing, but making end-to-end privacy/encryption fast, secure, and efficient at the same time is a whole other beast. All of this is made possible with BasedAI, and the ENTIRE process is decentralized for existing Llama LLM's and future GPT-5.  The accomplishment of combining the following together is novel to the market. Not just to crypto, but to the entire AI market. This is a feat of engineering, a true marvel.  1. Decentralized AI Layer 1. 2. Privacy: Efficient, fast and secure end-to-end encryption. (FHE and TFT) Optimized through a process called Cerberus Squeezing. 3. Large Language Models. 4. Yuma Consensus, ensuring constant competition among nodes (brains), fair reward distribution, and scalability. 5. EVM compatibility/smart contracts, dapps etc. 6. The ability for any existing service provider to transform their standard LLM's (Llama) into ZK-LLM's with BasedLang. 7. Written in BasedLang, a novel meta programming standard made just for BasedAI, making it easier for any dev to work with LLM's (crypto and non crypto). 8. Future compatibility with newer LLM's like GPT-5.  By now, you should already have a basic understanding of how the BasedAI network works. Today, we will add to that knowledge.

374,jyp,"TLDR for the TRUE story behind @pepecoins and what is @getbasedai all about:    1. The OG @pepecoins is the first ever #memecoin we had next to @dogecoin in 2016. It didn't launch through an ICO or smart contract as it was released before #Ethereum was a thing. It launched through mining like $BTC and $doge coin.    2. It was under the radar because bittrex forced them to rebrand to stay listed on their CEX. Why? In 2016, Pepecoin faced a major challenge, white supremacists and right-wing ideologists began using Pepe to spread their ideology and it reached a climax when Donald Trump posted a Pepe meme of himself. Hilary then accused Trump's campaign of maliciously spreading those Pepe memes.    3. the Anti Defamation League went on to list Pepe as a hate symbol and ultimately @pepecoins was forced to rebrand from $pepe to $meme. [Yes, as a loyal holder of @memeland assets, $meme was not the OG. $meme from @pepecoins was.]    4. In response to that, the @pepecoin team launched KEKDAQ, a decentralized meme and asset exchange protocol where users can store, create and safeguard their memes and digital assets preserving their rarity via encrypted IPFS storage on the memetic blockchain. Ultimately, @pepecoins team built the first functioning NFT marketplace we ever had, way before @opensea was a thing but it was out of the reason to maintain free speech and internet culture.    5. In 2018, the blockchain underwent a hard fork and @pepecoins started its transition phase from POW to POS. Finally on 29 Apr 2023, the team bridged #pepecoin to Eth using utxo lockups and named the eth based pepecoin $PEPE. However, $pepe was stolen by @pepecoineth in 2023. Team at @pepecoins mentioned that the 2023 $pepe stole their idea, narrative and even the logo and ran with it. Team also mentioned that what these bad actors cannot steal is their ability to innovate and they will dev their way to the top.    6. So here comes the next major phase of @pepecoins evolution : @getbasedai What is #basedAI? They are building an open AI Layer1 network where anyone can run their own decentralized AI model, powered by GPU mining or proof of useful work (PoUW) as they call it.    7. Pepecoin trains AI models by using an open source peer to peer decentralized pool of gpus and a proof of useful work model named PEPEAI allowing them to tap into raw computing power and that pool offers to train their very own chat AI bot called CHAT-GP33.    8. What they are building is that you could use your computer's power to contribute to training AI models. It goes way beyond a simple Chatbot, it is an entire infrastructure that uses the collective power of Orphan miners to train AI. It covers a wide range of applications that companies usually spend Millions on.     9. Contributions are rewarded just like in traditional mining if you provide 10% of the work, you receive 10% of the reward without wasting energy.    10. You can buy #pepecoin now and stake it to earn #basedAI.    11. NFA, DYOR and investing in good teams is the best way to win in the coming cycle. ^if you sux at shitcoin trading.    12.

576,CryptoAmsterdam,"On a more serious note:   When I joined this space, I was in my early twenties and had just become a parent for the first time. Now, at 30, I'm expecting my fourth child.  Lately, I've been thinking a lot about the next decade. I've become so used to this lifestyle of paying 24/7 attention, clicking all day in the casino, and trying to be as early as possible with any new narrative and meta that I sometimes forget how fast life goes. Don't get me wrong, I'm able to spend a lot of time with my kids and family, but it's intense and we can't go on like this forever, right?  Sometimes it scares me how I always want to be early and how I have the urge to catch any new thing. And I enjoy them a lot, don't get me wrong; a new thing called socialfi? Let's find an edge and kill it! NFTs? Nice, let's dive into it headfirst.   The urge to click.  Would this be my last cycle like so many say every cycle again?  No. I could not just shut the door behind me and leave the space; I'm not going to sit home and do nothing, and I love it here. I've made and interacted with so many friends here every day and enjoy every single second of it.   But maybe I also have to accept that I'm not a kid anymore, and maybe I'm ready for another step or approach. I'll be spending the next bear market thinking about how to fill in the next years within this space.   Things I enjoy in this space besides degen clicking:  > Making longer-term investments and a more HTF approach > Networking and helping projects or friends connect with each other. > Working with projects I like. > Writing and helping people on Twitter. > My (free) community.  Maybe one last 24/7 click cycle, and then slow down and zoom out?

631,BATMAN ⚡,"You have probably seen the term ""inscriptions"" all over CT over the past few months. It's one of the hottest new trends in crypto, and isn't showing any signs of slowing down soon.  But what are inscriptions? Inscriptions are basically a new way of adding data to a blockchain such as Bitcoin by attaching it to the metadata of an individual cryptocurrency. On Bitcoin, for example, where inscriptions are currently most common, data such as text, images and videos is attached to individual sats (satoshis - the smallest unit of Bitcoin).  There's one protocol which is very well positioned to capture the growth of this new vertical - @inscribe_app  Inscribe is the first ever cross-chain inscriptions marketplace that enables users to trade inscriptions across multiple different blockchains in 1 unified hub. Version 0.1 is operational on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, ZkSync, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, Base, Fantom, Gnosis and Polygon!  Users can connect their preferred wallet like MM or Rabby and then purchase any inscription listed on Inscribe's marketplace, regardless of the chain it's on. Inscribe abstracts away the difficulty of bridging funds cross-chain and executing the transaction on the native chain, allowing users to interact with blockchains they are not natively operating on.  By offering a cross-chain marketplace with unified liquidity, Inscribe makes it easier than ever to trade this growing crypto asset class!  But Inscribe also offers many other inscription services beyond just a marketplace. The Inscribe web app and bot enables users to deploy, mint and transfer inscriptions on and between any connected chains. They’re also soon releasing their launchpad, with @Architex_ai already announced as the first project to be listed!  The platform will generate revenue by charging fees for their range on inscriptions services, and perhaps some of this revenue will be shared with stakers of the platform’s native token $INS  There is currently an ongoing incentivized points campaign, and with 7% of the supply allocated to an airdrop this could be a protocol worth interacting with!

833,Altcoin Sherpa,"Why do people like trading vs. just buy and hold?  A few reasons IMO:  it feels like you're actively making money and can 'pay yourself'.   Ie. you buy $BTC at 40k and you sell it at 42k. You have your principle $ and can cash out the profits to your bank account. You can take that $ and go to the next trade and also make $ actively  It feels much different than if you just buy BTC and hold it for 6 months. Because the trading aspect involves more skill and you can actually reap more rewards (when done correctly).   With that said, it's oftentimes hard to trade in certain conditions AND most people fuck it up. And in super strong bull markets, the majority of participants would probably be better off holding than actively trading.  Still, if you're full time crypto, you've got bills to pay. I get it. You need to make some $ and it feels lame to just buy some random small cap and wait for it to 100x. So you will continue to draw support/resistance lines on the chart and continue to learn.   The general path that I've seen most crypto participants go towards is:  Poor/grinding-> trading a ton, learning the ropes, trying to get any $ you can get, flip around, rotate, etc  Mid rich-> swing trading more, able to hold ideas longer, still have entry/exits, less rotation  Whale-> Less risk overall, happy to just have longer holding periods, maybe shift more to venture, more buy and hold and just go into a coma (aka DegenSpartan).   because the richer you are, the more you are in protection mode vs. pure growth.  I'm not saying you can't be profitable trading. It's much easier in the bull market when easy mode is on and you can simply buy every dip. But with that said, I think that the best path for most people is to just do research, buy some coins in a sector you like (ie. AI), and just hold and do your regular day to day.  But if you're actively in the trenches and actively trading every day because you are a degenerate and fighting with everyone else in the orderbooks...  As a fellow retail trader...
