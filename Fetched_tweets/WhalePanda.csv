0,WhalePanda,"A thread on moving abroad (in my case Dubai)  2.5 years ago I moved to Dubai with my wife and 2 kids and it was one of the best decisions I've made in my life.  Some personal context:  I was born and raised in Belgium, the center of Europe. I always lived close to my parents who came over very often to visit the kids. I never had the intention of moving to another country. I did travel a lot and I've met many of you around the globe.  Then with the Covid hysteria and lockdowns I actually felt more and more how insane the policies in the West were. I was paying 50% income tax + 21% VAT on everything and meanwhile I saw the quality of life deteriorate rapidly.  My son was going to kindergarten/FS2 (depending on your school system) and the quality of education was horrible. Private schools aren't really a thing in Belgium, you have a handful in the 2 major cities (Antwerp and Brussels) but these are the exception and 95% of the students are from expats. Belgium's public education system used to be top notch, growing up I always felt that for me it worked great. But when my son went to school, he wasn't challenged, everything went at the pace of the slowest kids. He was bored in school and I felt I was letting him down.  At the time we were living in a small village (10k people) in a nice house with a huge garden, I loved that house. It was at the end of a cul de sac and no one ever came there. Then in 12 months time we had 2 burglaries in 2 different houses in the street. For the first one our house was actually the main target, however we got lucky since I accidentally left the lights on everywhere. On the cameras I installed I saw them jump over our 2 meter (6.5 feet) fence, walk to the house, check inside and jump back over the fence. Since then we didn't really feel that safe anymore. The 2nd burgarly was during the day and they broke in to a house where they had 2 guard dogs and only ran away when the owners came home. They were never caught, the police didn't do much.  The combination of covid hysteria, bad education, safety concerns and high taxation while not getting anything in return made me actively start looking for alternatives.",04/16/2024 10:35 AM,False,880,102,100
1,WhalePanda,"Yesterday's ETF flows by @FarsideUK   The ETF flows were slightly negative and when it's slightly negative you know that it's always just $GBTC that has outflows. $54.9 million.  Ark took in 13.3 million and the rest stayed at 0 or close to 0.  Price recovered from $56.5k back to $60k.  Yesterday the official inflow numbers for the Hong Kong ETFs came out and they have $248 million under management. One thing to note here is that HK ETFs allow in kind contribution, so rather than always having to buy from the market, you can actually deposit BTC with them directly.

49,WhalePanda,"Classic Dubai Criticism  It's build by slaves The workers, mostly from South East Asia, that come here to work make multiples of what they earn back at home. No their passport doesn't get taken away, no they're not forced to work all day in the heat. The government has worked hard to remove the bad apples, which are everywhere. Most are happy to have the opportunity to work here. They are a vital part of the economy and having them being treated badly would be horrible for the PR.  Women don't have any rights/It's oppressive regime Women have equal rights as men. A lot of people seem to be confusing the UAE with Saudi Arabia. Yes, I am totally fine with my daughter growing up here and she has every opportunity a boy has.  There's no culture! What's culture to you? All movies, ballets, opera, concerts, etc are happening here too. You have a lot of exhibitions and galleries. The boom that Dubai has seen in the last 30 years is incomparable to anything in the west so yes everything is newer. You can still visit old parts too or museums about when it was just a pearl diving village. What you're really saying is that you prefer old buildings. That's cool, I love the architecture in Vienna. Or the old city in Bruges. But there are many aspects of culture and you're just making up things. I'd argue that here they actually are exposed to more culture. My kids have Chinese friends with whom they've celebrated Chinese New Year, they learn about Ramadan, they learn about Diwali.  It's not a democracy! That's true, and you know this before you move. A democracy sounds good on paper but in practice, how is it going in Europe, or in the US? They can't implement long term plans since they only care about power and re-election. A benevolent dictatorship always works way better than any democracy. I know this is going to trigger a lot of people but if you're honest with yourself, you know that this is true. ""But what if this changes"" then you leave, it's as simple as that. No one is going to keep you captive. The rulers of the UAE had a long term vision to implement something like Singapore and attract a lot of foreign investors. You can't successfully implement a long term vision without stability. You don't need to like it, but it's a fact. For example 2 years ago UAE was still using the old Friday/Saturday weekend, which wasn't in line with the rest of the world. The one day beginning of December they said ""ok from the 1st of January the weekend will be Saturday/Sunday like the rest of the world"" to be more business friendly/compatible. Everyone panicked, schools, businesses but guess what, 3 weeks later everyone managed to pull it off. In Europe they've been arguing about daylight savings time for more than 10 years now. Again: I'm not saying it's perfect, far from, but for sure works better than 99% of the democracies out there.  Sharia law/Islam Yes the UAE is a Muslim country and how often do you notice that on a daily basis? Hardly ever. The UAE depends on expats, they need people to come here for both tourism and to live and work here for business. The majority of their income is coming from these sources, not from oil as some might think. They understood this early on and that is why technically they have Sharia law in practice it is very lenient and as open as the west.  Yes, you can buy alcohol here. Not just in restaurants/bars with a liquor license but pretty much every mall now has a liquor store. They recently removed the high taxes on it too (although the hotels still charge the same amount for their drinks)  Yes you can buy pork here. There are special areas (""non-muslim"") in supermarkets where you can get all the bacon or Jamon Iberico that you want.  You can't wear what you want! Yes you can, besides in mosques and government buildings, they're not going to say anything about it. There are signs in the mall that you need to dress modestly, but tbh from what I've seen, anything really goes. That being said if you're man and want to go into an official government building you won't get in in shorts. Long pants are needed.   What about gay people? I know a couple of gay couples that happily live here together for many years.  You can also officially live together without being married.  But I've heard about people getting arrested in the UAE for yelling and swearing. What were they yelling? Were they just being ghetto? Good that they got arrested. Libel laws are quite strong here, something to be mindful of.  Also in the UAE there are 2 genders fwiw.",04/17/2024 11:57 AM,False,69,5,12
50,WhalePanda,"What I don't love about Dubai  Scammers While your traditional crimes aren't that common as in the West, you have a different kind that really is annoying. Everyone at some level is trying to scam you. You have the obvious ones, you get a fake call from ""Dubai police"" or your bank and they try to get information out of you for malicious use. Everyone always tries to make money off of you, start with that assumption and interactions will become a lot easier and clearer. I'm not used to that. I think this also has to do with people not really caring that much about their own reputation. If you build a company in a place where you grew up and lived your entire life, you care a lot more about your reputation. Because Dubai has a lot of people moving in and out of the country, reputation is worth less.  Real estate agents They should go in the same category as scammers tbh. It is very easy to get a realtor license here, no need to take a course, you just need to take an exam and you'll get your license. That means almost everyone can be a realtor, since the real estate market has boomed here like crazy it also means that a lot of shady characters who have a good sales pitch are dominating this part of the economy. They will tell you literally anything to get the sale. ""Of course you can remove that wall"" ""Of course the apartment will be finished and handed over on time"", they just want to close and get their commission. I haven't met a single one yet that I can honestly say I trust and I met many. Never trust a realtor.  Banks First of all despite Dubai putting itself out there as crypto-friendly, the banks are the opposite. You think about sending or receiving money from a crypto exchange, you'll get your bank account closed. I always used a foreign bank to move money in and out and transfer money from there locally. Also the services aren't up to standard with many European/Swiss banks, the only thing that's relatively easy is bank account opening, but since they close bank accounts easily too and for random reasons it's smart to have at least 2-3 at the time.  Road infrastructure It's pretty bad. My wife told me that she read once in a book that ""Dubai's road infrastructure was designed and build by people not living in Dubai"". That's definitely what it feels like. I'm not even talking about the amount of traffic on the road. Dubai, unlike most European cities, has more the American model of ""everyone drives everywhere"" rather than walking. Don't try to walk in Dubai, not because of the weather, but just because it lacks the infrastructure (outside of maybe Downtown and JBR and obviously inside communities itself). In certain places if you miss an exit you need to drive 3-4 kms further to get another exit and drive back. This is not on a highway but in the city. The city has been growing a lot and traffic gets really bad from November till March/April which is the high season especially in Downtown and Marina.  Rain I guess I need to address this now especially after yesterday. When it rains the entire city shuts down. A lot of the older areas are not designed for rain, in the past there were many years without any real rain. This has increased exponentially with cloud seeding. I compare it with Belgium as soon as it snows. No one knows how to drive anymore and work and school become a mess and everyone just stays home. Yesterday's rain was truly exceptional though, it rained 4 times the annual amount in 24 hours.",04/17/2024 09:18 AM,False,87,3,28

52,WhalePanda,"What I love about Dubai  As soon as someone says he/she likes Dubai you always get the same negative comments so I'll address the less desirable parts in the next part which I will write tomorrow or on Thursday.  No personal income tax Well that's an obvious one and maybe even the number 1 reason why most people move here. They did implement a 9% corporate tax now over $100k profit. They also have 5% VAT. They had to implement taxes to get off the FATF grey list.  Safety Again a very obvious one. When you go to Starbucks you can leave your phone or laptop on a table to reserve the place for yourself without any fear of them getting taken. A woman can walk on the street at night by herself without any worries about getting harassed or worse. No fears of pickpockets or other crimes. You can leave your car unlocked anywhere, most people leave their houses and apartments unlocked. My wife stepped into the wrong car once in a parking lot at a mall and only realized when she tried to start it, it wasn't ours. Does that mean that there's no crime? There is always some crime but most of them are either scams or when it's about burglary/theft usually they get caught. If you commit a crime, you'll get deported.  Education This is from my perspective as someone who's used to public education in Belgium. The schools and facilities are insane. The level of education in the private schools is exceptional, since there are so many new families moving to Dubai there are also a lot of new schools being build and opening up. Everything is brand new and high quality. The school my kids go to now is, in my opinion, super expensive, however I compared it to the school we had picked out in Lugano and from what I've heard from friends in the US... it's still a lot cheaper here for this kind of education. The kids absolutely love it.  Healthcare Again from my perspective as someone who didn't really have private healthcare in Belgium: the level of healthcare here is top notch. No 5-6 months wait for checkups or procedure. Same day if it's really urgent or else for sure within 2-3 days. My son needed braces and that was all done really fast and smooth. In Belgium there are long waitlists for specialized dentists. Private healthcare also means private health insurance and that does get costly too. A Mexican friend had her parents visiting, the mother slipped and fell and broke her wrist. She was taken to the hospital by ambulance, had x-ray taken, cast put on and all that within 1.5 hour and at the end she didn't have to pay anything since it was a medical emergency.  Connectivity I've come to value this even more. Once you go Emirates, you're not going back. Yes, yes there are other premium airlines with similar, or arguably better service but you have to admit that it's great. Direct flights to everywhere in the world, Dubai is an amazing travel hub. I'm not flying to Europe much anymore but taking the kids to Asia and Africa has been simply amazing. All within reasonable flying time and without annoying layovers.  Cultural diversity This one might trigger some people with PTSD. I've met people from all over the world that live here. What happens often, especially in many parts of Europe, if you move there as a foreigner it is extremely hard to integrate into the community. I'll take Belgium as an example: everyone in the area I grew up had the village mentality: you're born, raised, marry, have kids and die in the same place. You make friends in school and those will be your friends for the rest of your life. That's it. 90% immigrants has the advantage that everyone made a big move to move out of their home country. Everyone has a different story and (almost) everyone is quite open and friendly to new people since it takes a lot of courage to make a move like that. People tend to be more open-minded. The downside then is that you have people that are here only for a couple of years. They come here to work, make money and leave. Those friendships aren't long lasting so there's always a coming and going of friends. Another good thing about cultural diversity is that no matter what food you're looking for: you're going to find and since there are so many people from different countries here: it's going to be amazing.",04/16/2024 04:19 PM,False,184,8,29
53,WhalePanda,"Picking the right place to live  I like order and I like lists. I started making a list of my requirements to move to a new country. This is going to be different for pretty much every person and let me start of by saying ""There is no perfect country"".  For me personally the following were the most important requirements: - Safety - Good education - No/low taxes - Good Quality of Life - Good weather  Less important factors still to be considered: - Friendliness to expats - English speaking - No natural disasters (guess this also falls under safety) - Easy to travel to/from - Entertainment for me and the kids  First things first: I didn't want to live in the EU anymore. I feel that the EU is just a ticking time bomb and everything is just getting worse. The only exception to this would've potentially been Madeira. Madeira had a lot of potential but then fell short for me personally in the end.  I've done my research on all Caribbean Islands and while exceptionally beautiful and no taxes there are a lot of other issues there.  So naturally I came to the conclusion to move to... Switzerland. Yeah I didn't even consider Dubai at that time, it felt far away from my family and the weather so I hadn't even given it a proper evaluation at that point.  Switzerland was the logical solution, safe, stable, center of Europe, while outside of the EU. We would still have to pay taxes but that would be possible with a lump sum payment. Cost of living was a concern and the fact that we would have to learn Italian wasn't ideal but better than Belgium for sure. We were actively looking for properties in the Lugano area because weather-wise that's as close to Mediterranean climate as you can get. We found a school, which was very expensive and not perfect but better than the one in Belgium. Told my tax advisor to plan everything for a move to Switzerland. Told my parents we were moving to Switzerland. Everything seemed ready. This was in February-March 2021.  I had planned a beach holiday to Dubai for April 2020. But you know what happened in early 2020, the world shut down and we weren't able to travel. So I had it rescheduled for the Easter break at school for April 2021.  We came to Dubai and loved the holiday. There were so many things to do for both adults and kids. Everything was designed for the heat and indoors, you move from AC to AC when it's hot. We felt safe and during the vacation my wife jokingly said that we should move there instead. All the prejudices of being in a Muslim country just faded away.  When we got back to Belgium I did some more research and it made a lot more sense for us to move to Dubai. No taxes, high quality of life, real estate is way more affordable in Dubai, private school was in English and higher quality and while Lugano is absolutely beautiful... there really isn't that much to do there.",04/16/2024 10:46 AM,False,235,11,46

232,Bruce Fenton,"Land of the Free?  Good morning from Dubai again.   Some people ask how I, as a libertarian ancap who is focused on freedom and human rights, could support Dubai and the UAE.  It’s precisely because of its excellent human rights achievements that I support the UAE.   It’s not even close when compared with the USA 🇺🇸.  UAE 🇦🇪 utterly surpasses the US in human rights in almost every meaningful way.  To quote Sam Jackson:  It ain't the same ballpark, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same sport.   I’m an expert on both places and on human liberty and freedom.  I’ve lived in both countries.  I’ve studied classic liberalism, free markets and liberty for nearly 20 years. I’m acutely aware of the many criticisms of the UAE on worker rights, gay rights and other issues. I’ve read, researched and spoken first hand with workers, residents, visitors, government officials and critics & found the majority to be claims to be baseless or false and with others improving.   Neither country is perfect. Both countries have areas they could improve on in human liberty.  But there is simply no comparison.  UAE is *far* more free and has a far better record on human rights in thousands of ways, across the board and in most categories.   The UAE most clearly dominates the US on the most important area of human rights and freedom:  economic freedom and free markets.  Economic freedom is the base for other freedoms and is the primary engine to reduce crime, improve human rights and improve the happiness and quality of life for citizens.  From this base other day to day freedoms flow.  In this regard UAE is a clear winner.  This is why the best and brightest flock here by the thousands: to pursue a better life, better opportunities and to invent, build and create jobs…leaving authoritarian failures like San Francisco to wallow in destruction, depression and filth.   Most Americans live in a propaganda bubble fueled by echos of a long gone past — a past where we as a nation respected property rights, our government followed the Constitution, we had a fair and balanced justice system, free speech, free markets, entrepreneurship and the American dream.  But that past just doesn’t exit anymore.    Those days are long gone and to pretend they are still here ignores the unbelievably serious problems of the USA and dooms us to not fix them.  Tragically, the US is not a free country anymore.  I love my country - but it is deeply broken and in need of major repair.  UAE can continue to improve but it’s trend is one of improvement not of decline.   For the day to day lives of most people, UAE is a winning model.  The greatest achievements of the UAE over the last 20 years have come from freedom: allowing people to build and live.  I hope the US can learn from its success and embrace our roots of freedom. I pray the US will go back to its greatness, stop being a punchline and once again be a model for the world.  In the meantime, UAE is an obvious choice for those who care about economic and human liberty.",02/02/2024 05:21 AM,True,360,81,67

The next Bitcoin halving will be around the 17th of April. Of course this is not priced in, it never is, but the real effect of the halving on the supply only becomes noticeable after a couple of months.
